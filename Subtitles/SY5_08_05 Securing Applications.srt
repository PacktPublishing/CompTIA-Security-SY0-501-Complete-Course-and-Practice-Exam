1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,890
- Securing applications.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,830
By far the most commonly
used productivity suite

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,310
in the world is Microsoft Office.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,590
This includes Word for word processing,

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,040
Excel for Spreadsheets,
PowerPoint for slide presentation,

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,610
Outlook for email, and many others.

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,292
Now, how can we protect the
applications themselves,

8
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:21,310
and the files that they create?

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, that's what we're going
to cover in this lesson.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,280
First, let's talk about the obvious.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,070
If you have a document and you
want to protect its content,

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,070
you should use a password to do it.

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,970
It's a really simple built in feature

14
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,900
across the Office suite.

15
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,930
To create a password to
protect your files from

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,110
modification, or even being viewed,

17
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,010
you can do this using the password protect

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,630
feature under the tools menu bar option.

19
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,030
As shown here on the
screen, this is an example

20
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,340
from Microsoft Word, but it works in Word,

21
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,290
Excel and PowerPoint.

22
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,490
Also, your files can be set
to read only if you desire.

23
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,170
This will prevent any of your contents

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,880
from being modified by unauthorized users.

25
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,460
Another thing you want to think about

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,540
when it comes to security is macros.

27
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,804
And we talked about that a bit back

28
00:01:02,804 --> 00:01:05,640
when we talked about macro viruses.

29
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,970
You want to make sure you
check your macro settings.

30
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,820
You can find this under your preferences

31
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,340
or your tools options, and
then going to the security tab.

32
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,300
By default, you should
want to disable macros,

33
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,150
with or without notification.

34
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,090
This will increase the
security of your organization.

35
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,700
Now, when it's installed
originally by Microsoft,

36
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,240
macros are enabled, so
you want to take the time

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,660
to disable this in your baseline image.

38
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,140
Most organizations are
going to decide to disable

39
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,870
macros completely and
not even give their user

40
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,890
an option to be able to enable them.

41
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,760
To do this, you can set that
through your group policy

42
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,150
inside the Windows
server and push that out

43
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,690
to all of your clients.

44
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,890
Another way to secure your information

45
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,890
is to use digital certificates.

46
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,380
If your organization is already
using digital certificates

47
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,400
as part of its organizational security,

48
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,680
you should enable your
documents to be locked down

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,950
and only be opened by
the person presenting

50
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,690
a valid digital certificate.

51
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,690
This again is another option that you can

52
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,630
find inside of Word.

53
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,330
Additionally, you want to think about how

54
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,890
you're going to encrypt your documents

55
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,570
to protect their contents.

56
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,530
This can be done within
the Microsoft Office

57
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,740
products themselves, or you can use

58
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,600
the underlying system capabilities,

59
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,820
something like Bitlocker to Go.

60
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,270
So at this point, we have
some pretty secure files.

61
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,320
We've disabled our macros, we've password

62
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,490
protected them and we've encrypted them.

63
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,520
Let's go and shift our focus
over to email for a moment.

64
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,290
Inside the Microsoft Office suite,

65
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,570
there's a program called MS Outlook.

66
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,000
Microsoft Outlook is used for email

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,030
and if you embed your digital signatures

68
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,970
and digital certificate configurations

69
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,040
into Microsoft Outlook, you can have

70
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,010
increased email security.

71
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,600
This relies on a PKI or
public key infrastructure.

72
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,670
We'll talk about that when we get

73
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,610
into the cryptography section
of this course later on.

74
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,110
Now, another thing when we start talking

75
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,946
about Microsoft Outlook is that our emails

76
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:53,030
start getting to be
overwhelming sometimes,

77
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,580
and we have to start saving
space by archiving them off.

78
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,470
In Microsoft Outlook, the way we do this

79
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,780
is by archiving them to a PST file.

80
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,510
Now, this PST file though should be

81
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,360
encrypted or password protected if you're

82
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,060
going to to store it on
a large network share,

83
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,460
like a shared drive.

84
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,962
I see this a lot in organizations

85
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:12,960
where they'll only give
you a certain amount

86
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,670
of space on the email server.

87
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,620
Some people will archive
their files off into the PST

88
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,570
and then put that onto the shared drive.

89
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,740
If you're going to do
that, password protect it

90
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,490
and encrypt it for your
own safety and precaution.

91
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,960
Another concern we have when we deal

92
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,340
with email is spam and junk mail.

93
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,220
And you can get a lot of this.

94
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,150
If you want to start
removing a lot of that,

95
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,010
you should set up rules that will end up

96
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,982
filtering out that spam
both on your exchange server

97
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:39,630
as well as on your personal computer.

98
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,010
Again, Microsoft Outlook
will allow you to do this

99
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,589
on your application side
or Microsoft Exchange

100
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:47,087
will allow you to do
it on the server side.

101
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:49,624
So as we start wrapping up this lesson,

102
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:51,560
let's start talking about what you can do

103
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,690
to help protect yourself
from rogue applications.

104
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,930
Now this is going to move beyond
the Microsoft Office suite,

105
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,490
and into every other
application out there.

106
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,820
There's one key tool inside of Windows

107
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,900
that helps protect you.

108
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,490
It's called the User Account Control.

109
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,610
UAC is a security
component of Windows Vista

110
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,660
and newer operating systems
that keeps every user,

111
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,980
besides your actual administrator account

112
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,680
in a standard user mode.

113
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,630
And this way, when you
try to run a program,

114
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,590
it's going to ask you
if you want to be run

115
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,550
as an administrator and if so,

116
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,790
you need to put in the
administrator credentials.

117
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,812
So when you think about UAC
or User Account Control,

118
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:28,350
just think about the fact that it's going

119
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,150
to prevent unauthorized access

120
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,580
and avoid user error in the
form of accidental changes,

121
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,360
because it's running
everything as a standard user,

122
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,880
as opposed to running
it as an administrator.

123
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,790
Now in the next lesson,
I'm going to show you

124
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,410
how we can white list and
black list applications.

125
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,410
To keep any applications off your system,

126
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,590
that you don't want running

127
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,953
and allowing those that you do to be run.
