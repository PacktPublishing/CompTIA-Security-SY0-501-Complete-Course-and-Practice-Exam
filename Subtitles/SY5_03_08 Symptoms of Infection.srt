00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,500
- Symptoms of Infection.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,840
How do you know your computer

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,800
has been infected with malware?

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,800
Well, the most common thing is to notice

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,180
that it starts beginning to act strange.

6
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,700
That could be a myriad of
different things, though.

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,830
For example, your computer
might start running

8
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,190
slower than normal.

9
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,680
Why might this occur?

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,700
Well, if you have a worm for example,

11
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,770
it's using up processor
resources and network resources

12
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,460
to spread itself throughout the system

13
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,880
and throughout the network.

14
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,510
If you happen to be getting spam,

15
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,430
that again is something that's
going to tax your system.

16
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,960
Lots of different malware will
start making your computer

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,440
act slower than normal.

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,520
And this is one of the indications
that you have a problem.

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,140
Another symptom of infection

20
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,930
is that your computer starts locking up

21
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,120
or stops responding to you frequently.

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,970
Maybe you're seeing more
'blue screens of death'

23
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,610
than you've ever seen before.

24
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,390
Well, this again is something

25
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,360
that is a common symptom of malware.

26
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,130
If a virus goes in and
overwrites a critical system file

27
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,220
by mistake, that can cause the
computer to crash or lock up.

28
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,110
This brings us to our third thing.

29
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,490
If your computer restarts
or crashes a lot,

30
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,120
this again is another
symptom that you may have

31
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,960
a malware infection.

32
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,830
Next, if your hard drive,
files or applications

33
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,320
aren't accessible anymore,
this could be a symptom

34
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,780
of a malware infection.

35
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,720
Because if a virus or piece
of malware takes over a file,

36
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,270
it's going to change its permissions.

37
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,940
And by doing that, it can
remove your permissions

38
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,900
that allow you to run it
or delete it or change it.

39
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,850
This is one of the ways
that the malware will keep

40
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,910
persistence in your system.

41
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,180
Another symptom of malware

42
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,710
is if your computer starts
to make strange noises,

43
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,940
or you start to see
unusual error messages,

44
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,370
or your computer, the display
starts looking strange,

45
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,570
or when you print something,

46
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,650
it looks like gibberish or gobbledygook,

47
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,320
and it uses symbols
instead of normal letters.

48
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,020
All of these things can happen

49
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,290
when you get a virus or you get malware,

50
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,290
depending on the way the virus or malware

51
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,200
starts infecting your system.

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,340
Another sign that you
might have an infection

53
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,960
is if you start to see new
icons appear on your desktop

54
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,850
or conversely, icons from your
desktop start to disappear.

55
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,450
Again, as any additional
programs are added,

56
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,270
new icons might show up, and
if you start deleting programs,

57
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,460
that can remove those as well.

58
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,470
Another way that malware
tries to hide itself

59
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,720
when it's in your system is by
using double file extensions.

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,740
This is because in Windows, by default,

61
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,470
if there's a know file extension,

62
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,500
such as .exe for executable,
or .txt for text files,

63
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,330
that part won't be shown
on the icon's name.

64
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,680
So if you have something that says

65
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,970
textfile.txt on your desktop,

66
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,510
it could have a hidden
.exe at the end of it.

67
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,030
And when you double-click that file

68
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,600
that looks like a text file,

69
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,350
it's actually going to
run this executable file.

70
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,470
And that can actually embed malware

71
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,970
into your system even further.

72
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,610
Another symptom that you may
have had something bad happen

73
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,670
is if you try to run
your antivirus software

74
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,120
but it just won't run.

75
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,690
A lot of malware is programmed

76
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,510
to attack your antivirus software,

77
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,400
and that way it can
prevent it from running

78
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,830
and maintain persistence longer.

79
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,600
The reason for this is that malware

80
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,590
doesn't want to be taken
out of your system.

81
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,330
And if you're able to run your antivirus

82
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,300
you might be able to clean up the malware.

83
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,190
But if they can attack your antivirus

84
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,980
and keep it from running,
that means that they can

85
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,890
stay on your computer for
longer and dig in deeper.

86
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,180
Yet another symptom is
when your files or folders

87
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,130
are corrupted, or you may
see new files and folders

88
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,310
that have been created.

89
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,580
Again, as a piece of malware
goes and infects your files

90
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,830
this corruption can make them be deleted,

91
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,080
or it'll create new
files for it to hide in.

92
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,300
Again, the malware might do this as a way

93
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,800
to maintain persistence and
dig in deeper into your system.

94
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,990
And this can add new
files that get infected

95
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,630
and those files might be
put across the network.

96
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,570
The final symptom is if you try to go

97
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,080
and use your system restore
function within Windows

98
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,570
and you can't do it.

99
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,670
Because again, similarly
to what I talked about

100
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,170
with antivirus being
turned off by malware,

101
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,100
malware is going to try to
turn off your system restore,

102
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
because they don't want
you to be able to go back

103
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,710
and restore from a known good backup.

104
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,270
In this way, malware again

105
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,960
is trying to maintain that persistence.

106
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,700
All of these things are
really summarized quite simply

107
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,530
with one simple statement.

108
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,920
If your computer is
acting funny or strange

109
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,600
you may be infected with malware

110
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,770
and so it's best to boot up into safe mode

111
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,710
or boot from an external drive

112
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,667
and then scan your computer
with a good antivirus software.

113
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,045
(soft techno music)
