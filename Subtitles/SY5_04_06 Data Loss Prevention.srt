1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,780
- Data loss prevention.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,010
Data loss prevention is set up to monitor

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,670
the data of a system while it's in use,

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,810
in transit, or at rest.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,050
It does this, in order
to detect any attempts

6
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,840
to steal the data.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,630
Let's think about when we had data stored,

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,250
20 or 30 years ago.

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,890
Where did they store most of it?

10
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,380
Well, most businesses
stored it printed off,

11
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,810
and in a filing cabinet.

12
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,130
And if somebody wanted to get it,

13
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,860
they'd have to break into your offices,

14
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,040
open the filing cabinet, and
physically take the files.

15
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,133
This limited the amount of information

16
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:31,810
that somebody could steal from you,

17
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,010
because they really could only steal,

18
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,720
what they could carry with them.

19
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,030
Then, we started allowing
people to work remotely,

20
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,460
and a lot of data was stored on laptops.

21
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,960
If you happened to stop for lunch

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,790
and you left your laptop
sitting in your car,

23
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,330
somebody could've broken in your car,

24
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,730
and stolen your laptop.

25
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,100
And they now have access to
all the data that was on it.

26
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,180
The next evolution in data theft occurred

27
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,550
when we started using
external hard drives.

28
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,090
These started being used,
all throughout our offices.

29
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,670
These hard drives could
hold large amounts of data.

30
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,950
We could plug it into the
network, through our laptop,

31
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,400
and download a ton of
information and data,

32
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,210
and then walk out of the building with it.

33
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,410
But, these were kind of
large and easy to detect.

34
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,360
Next, we started seeing thumb drives,

35
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,910
that hold just as much as
these external hard drives,

36
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,410
carrying billions of
documents out the front door

37
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,870
with no one knowing it,
because they're so small,

38
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,770
and fit right in your pocket.

39
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,200
But wait, we don't even
need to do that nowadays,

40
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,190
because we have things like
Dropbox and Google Drive,

41
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,780
where we get terabytes of
storage available to you,

42
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,080
hooked up to the network.

43
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,940
And I could sit there

44
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,120
and upload everything your company has,

45
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,880
and get access to it,
anywhere in the world.

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,250
This is a huge problem for businesses,

47
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,740
because our data and our
intellectual property

48
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,570
is what the currency of
business is these days.

49
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,280
To protect it, we have to use
data loss prevention systems.

50
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,860
These systems come as either
software or hardware solutions.

51
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,560
The first data loss prevention
system we're going to talk about

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,120
is an endpoint DLP system.

53
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,230
An endpoint system, is
usually a piece of software

54
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,930
that's installed on a
workstation or a laptop,

55
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,280
and it's going to monitor
the data that's in use

56
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,310
on that computer.

57
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,700
And if someone tries
to do a file transfer,

58
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,520
it'll either stop that file transfer,

59
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,670
or it'll alert the admin of the occurrence

60
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,700
based on certain rules and policies.

61
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,950
Very much liked an IDS or an
IPS would, but focused on data.

62
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,640
DLPs can be set to detection
mode, or prevention mode.

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,660
The next one we have,
is a network DLP system.

64
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,940
This is a piece of software or hardware,

65
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,720
that's a solution placed at
the perimeter of your network.

66
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,170
It's sole function in life,

67
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,170
is to check all of the data going into,

68
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,350
and out of your network,

69
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,260
with a special focus on things
going out of the network.

70
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,310
They want to detect data in transit,

71
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,460
that shouldn't be leaving the building.

72
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,420
The third type we have,
is called storage DLP.

73
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,520
This is a software that's
installed on a server

74
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,810
in the data center and inspects the data

75
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,830
while its at rest, on the server.

76
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,740
This is usually because
they've encrypted it

77
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,870
or watermarked it,

78
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,850
and we want to make sure
that nobody's accessing

79
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,240
the data at times that they shouldn't be.

80
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,260
For example, if someone starts downloading

81
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,560
large amounts of data
at two in the morning,

82
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,040
that's probably against your policy,

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,110
and the DLP could catch it.

84
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,640
The fourth type of DLP, is
a cloud-based DLP system.

85
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,670
These systems are usually offered
as software, as a service,

86
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,260
and it's part of your cloud
service and storage needs.

87
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,390
They're going to protect your data

88
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,090
when it's stored inside
those cloud services.

89
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,960
For example, my company uses Google Drive

90
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,860
and we have data loss prevention,

91
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,860
as part of a cloud
service, offered by Google.

92
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,400
In summary, these data
loss prevention solutions

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,860
are made to be accurate in a way

94
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,380
that they stop data from
leaving your network.

95
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,510
They're going to go through,
and look at data at rest,

96
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,720
data in use, and data in transit,

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,780
to ensure that it's following

98
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,740
the policies you've set up
as a security administrator,

99
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,193
so you could protect that
asset of your company.

100
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,101
