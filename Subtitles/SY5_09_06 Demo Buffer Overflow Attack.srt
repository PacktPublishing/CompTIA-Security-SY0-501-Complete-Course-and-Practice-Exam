1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,300
- [Instructor] In this
demonstration I'm going to show you

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,330
how a Buffer Overflow Attack is conducted.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,840
Now, I'm going to do this by using

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,190
a simple program that's written here.

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,240
This program is called Narnia 0.C.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,000
This tells me that the program was written

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,100
in the C programming language.

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,210
You can see it displayed
here on the screen.

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,470
Now you don't have to be
an expert in the C language

10
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,500
to understand what this
program is doing, though.

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,450
I'm going to walk you
through it step by step.

12
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,380
And then I'm going to
show you how we throw this

13
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,880
Buffer Overflow Attack
too exploit this program.

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,530
Now the first thing that we
can see is that there are

15
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,210
two statements that start
with the word include.

16
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,040
This is just saying that
were going to include

17
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,890
these third-party libraries.

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,130
The standard input output library,

19
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,203
and the standard library itself.

20
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,000
After those two include statements

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,610
we get the main part of this program.

22
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,380
This is called Main.

23
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,980
If you see the first thing,
we have a long variable.

24
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,989
And that value is 0x

25
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:57,300
four one, four one, four one, four one.

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,660
Followed by that, we
have a character array

27
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,570
being set up called Buffer,
that is 20 items long.

28
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,020
This means that the buffer can only hold

29
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,520
20 pieces of information, or
20 characters, in this case.

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,570
Next we have the print F statement.

31
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,810
Which basically says

32
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,440
put everything in between
the quotes onto the screen

33
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,350
when you run this program.

34
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,790
Then, if it goes and asks you
here is your chance to try it.

35
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,690
And then it asks by scanning

36
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,540
what the input is from the keyboard.

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,740
And that input is going to
be stored into the buffer.

38
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,890
Once you've inputted what
you want to the buffer,

39
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,650
it's going to print out the two variables.

40
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,080
What's stored in buffer,
and what's stored in value.

41
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,590
After displaying both
variables to the screen

42
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,130
it's going to see what the value was.

43
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,500
If the value equals 0x DEADBEEF,

44
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,290
meaning we've overflowed the buffer

45
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,630
with the characters that make up DEADBEEF

46
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,270
then the system will
give you a shell prompt.

47
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,890
Which means you're going to
have access to that system

48
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,550
to conduct any kind of programs you want.

49
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,945
If not, it's going to say way off

50
00:01:57,945 --> 00:01:59,690
and it's going to exit the program.

51
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,570
And you'll have to try again.

52
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,780
So now that we've walked
through that program a bit

53
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,120
let's go ahead and run
it and see how it works.

54
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,240
First we'll type in ./narnia0

55
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,168
which simply tells a computer
to run the program Narnia0.

56
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:15,040
When I hit enter you'll
see that it brings up

57
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,760
the correct value is from

58
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,763
41, 41, 41, 41 to DEADBEEF.

59
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,110
Here is your chance, and it's
asking you to input something.

60
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,420
So now I need to input my guess.

61
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,190
What I'm going to do, is
I'm going to put in 20 A's

62
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,900
and four B's.

63
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,640
The buffer, if you remember,
was only 20 characters long.

64
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,970
So what I'm really trying to do here

65
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,120
is fill up that 20 character buffer

66
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,360
using all of the A's,

67
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,050
and those four B's are going to overflow

68
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,820
into the value of the variable val.

69
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,570
So instead of having four one,
four one, four one, four one

70
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,770
I'm going to have the
hex value of those 4 B's.

71
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,860
And when I do that you'll see
that the buffer is now flowing

72
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,890
with all of those A's, and those four B's

73
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,780
and the value has changed

74
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,290
from four one, four
one, four one, four one,

75
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,660
to four two, four two, four two, four two.

76
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,290
And four two, is the hex
representation of the letter B.

77
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,060
So now at this point
I'm going to go through

78
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,510
and try to write a short python script

79
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,870
that will put 20 A's followed by some

80
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,850
hexadecimal characters that I want.

81
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,450
In this case I want the hexadecimal value

82
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,536
to show up as DEADBEEF.

83
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:22,150
D-E-A-D-B-E-E-F.

84
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,940
Now, those are characters that
make up a word in this case

85
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,150
but actually they're
just hexadecimal digits.

86
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,523
Where the D stands for
13, the E stands for 14,

87
00:03:30,523 --> 00:03:33,750
the A stands for 10, et cetera.

88
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,010
So what we're going to do is

89
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,070
we're going to have to do
this a little bit backwards,

90
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,970
and the reason is because
this machine is going to use

91
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,570
last in, first out architecture

92
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,060
when I'm trying to attack it.

93
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,667
So in this case I'm going to use /ef, /be,

94
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:51,620
/ad, /de

95
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,130
which when combined back together

96
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,460
will give me DEADBEEF like I want.

97
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,460
And I'm going to pipe that output
into the Narnia 0.C program.

98
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,290
So when I hit enter, it's
going to run that program

99
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,350
and feed that information from
the python script into it.

100
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,870
In this case, the buffer
is now overwritten

101
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,650
with those 20 A's,

102
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,900
and the four hexadecimal
characters that I've added.

103
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,210
And you can see that the variable val

104
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,660
has now been overwritten

105
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,580
with the value of 0x DEADBEEF.

106
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,950
This was the solution we
wanted in the problem.

107
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,140
But, all it did was return
us back to the Narnia prompt.

108
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,460
That's because what the
program did was run itself

109
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,770
and execute a shell.

110
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,320
But I was already in
the shell environment.

111
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,980
If I was doing a Buffer
Overflow Attack like this,

112
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,510
I can have it run any program I want.

113
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,970
And so to do that and
display that for you,

114
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,798
I'm going to go through,
and actually change

115
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:45,270
my python script just a bit here.

116
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,650
So I'm going to run my
python script again,

117
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,300
but I'm going to add a little bit to it.

118
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,250
So I'm going to bring it
up like I had last time

119
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,380
and I'm going to add a
semicolon, which means

120
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,160
once you've finished do that command

121
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,700
do this next command.

122
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,940
And so what I'm going to do here is echo,

123
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,010
and then the program cat,

124
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,290
and I want you to show me the file

125
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,730
Narnia one, inside the
Naria paths directory.

126
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,880
Ideally this would be
something like a password file.

127
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,620
Like an etc shadow file,
or something like that.

128
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,730
And then I'm going to
go ahead and run that.

129
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,660
Now let's see what happens.

130
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,460
In this case we see
that the DEADBEEF value

131
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,310
is written to the value.

132
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,400
But then when it goes to
execute that shell command

133
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,700
it was passed the command that I gave it.

134
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,497
The cat/etc/narnia_pass/narnia1.

135
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,280
And so what I get the
value shown in that file.

136
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,280
In this case that e-f-e-i-d-i-e-d-a-e.

137
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,010
Now this is just a very simplistic example

138
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,720
of a Buffer Overflow Attack.

139
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,350
If you didn't understand all of the things

140
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,427
that I went through in
this video, that's okay.

141
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:49,800
This is way beyond the
scope of Security Plus.

142
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,330
But I wanted to show you
what a Buffer Overflow Attack

143
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,560
really looks like when a hacker
is doing this type of thing.

144
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,800
This is a sample for our lab environment,

145
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,420
but I just wanted to give
you an idea of what happens.

146
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,230
And the big take away here is that

147
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,060
we overflowed the memory buffer,

148
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,200
so that whatever was put in after

149
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,750
went and overwrote the
next value in memory.

150
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,240
In our case, then val variable.

151
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,310
By doing that we are then
able to run other programs,

152
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,050
by getting into a command
shell or other things.

153
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,410
Whatever command that's going to be run

154
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,460
is going to depend on
the exploit you're using.

155
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,370
But that initial buffer overflow is what

156
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,647
