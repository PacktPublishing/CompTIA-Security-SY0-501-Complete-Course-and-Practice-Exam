1
00:00:00,189 --> 00:00:02,088
- Vulnerability management.

2
00:00:02,088 --> 00:00:05,280
A vulnerability assessment
seeks to identify issues

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,190
in a network, application,
database, or other IT systems

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,830
prior to it being
inadvertently or purposely used

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,480
to compromise a system.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,130
Vulnerability assessments
are a formalized process

7
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:19,520
that define, identify, and
classify the security holes

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,550
in an enterprise network architecture.

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,590
It's also used to
forecast the effectiveness

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,880
of proposed countermeasures

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,000
as part of your overall
risk analysis process.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,500
Now once these countermeasures
are put in place,

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,070
a follow-up vulnerability assessment

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,240
can help you to determine

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,410
how effective your
countermeasures truly are

16
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,570
in protecting that network from attack.

17
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,650
The management and
oversight of this process

18
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,130
is known as vulnerability management.

19
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,710
Vulnerability management is the practice

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,810
of finding and mitigating
the vulnerabilities

21
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,740
in your computers in your networks.

22
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,810
This is a very cyclical process.

23
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,200
Sometimes you'll hear this
referred to as scan, patch, scan

24
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,410
because you need to scan the network

25
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,300
for vulnerabilities to identify them,

26
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,430
then you're going to prioritize
all these vulnerabilities,

27
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,220
you're going to fix them and patch them,

28
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,660
and then you're going to scan again,

29
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,610
and you're going to keep doing this

30
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,920
until hopefully one day, you
have no vulnerabilities left.

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,753
Good luck with that.

32
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:08,790
It's never going to happen,
but that's the idea.

33
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,740
Now when you develop this
process within your organization,

34
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,090
you have to figure out what the goal

35
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,900
of your vulnerability
assessment is going to be

36
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,240
because this is going to help you design

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,120
a specific type of
vulnerability assessment

38
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,130
that you're going to utilize

39
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,750
and help you scope the overall assessment.

40
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,300
There are three main questions

41
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,490
that you need to think about

42
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,160
before you're going to design
a vulnerability assessment.

43
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,600
First, what is the
value of the information

44
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,380
that could be discovered
through the system compromise?

45
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,410
Second, what is the specific threat

46
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,890
that your system is facing?

47
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,840
And third, what mitigation
strategies could be deployed

48
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,950
to address the issues that are found?

49
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,680
Let's consider the first question.

50
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,180
What is the value of information
that could be discovered

51
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,160
through a compromise of the system?

52
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,810
This is going to help me
decide how much resources

53
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,320
and what kind of resources
I'm going to allocate

54
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,940
to identifying and fixing possible issues.

55
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,550
Let me give you a couple examples.

56
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,770
If you're a Coca-Cola

57
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,610
and you have a certain
file server in your network

58
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,460
that contains your proprietary formula

59
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,490
for the best soft drink ever made,

60
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,430
you'd want to dedicate a lot of resources

61
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,040
to protecting that server.

62
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,600
Now if you had another server

63
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,010
that had all of your public affairs,

64
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,330
things like your commercials
for the past 10 years,

65
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,660
you might not care about
protecting that nearly as much

66
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,220
because those are already
out in the public domain.

67
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,920
Next let's consider the
question of the specific threats

68
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,770
that are applicable to your system.

69
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,660
Each type of computer is
vulnerable to different attacks.

70
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,470
A Linux web server running Apache

71
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,000
has different vulnerabilities on it

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,940
than a Microsoft Windows-based web server

73
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,070
running Internet Information Services.

74
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,880
Both of these servers have
very different vulnerabilities

75
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,760
than a Cisco router or switch.

76
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,750
As you can see here,

77
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,310
the differences in their
operating system, configurations,

78
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,900
and operational use case
is going to make them prone

79
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,190
to different vulnerabilities,

80
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,490
and different threats
are going to attack them.

81
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,120
Now the final question is
what mitigation strategies

82
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,140
or security controls could we deploy

83
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,200
to address the issues that we find?

84
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,100
Well, let's look at another example.

85
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,020
If you decide to perform
a vulnerability scan

86
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,540
of every client on the network

87
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,910
and you found the same vulnerability
on every single client,

88
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,660
what mitigation strategy
could you use to fix it?

89
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,630
If it was me, I'd
probably want to make sure

90
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,820
that my patch server is working correctly,

91
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,680
and I'd want to make sure
that I'm pushing out a patch

92
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,240
to every client from this
centralized patch server

93
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,170
to make sure that everyone
gets the updated security fix.

94
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,350
Now what if there's no
patch available yet?

95
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,230
Well, then we have to look at the exploit

96
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,070
that the vulnerability is going after.

97
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,560
Let's say that this
vulnerability was being exploited

98
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,090
because somebody is going over Port 445,

99
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,360
what's that port again?

100
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,193
That's right.

101
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:31,460
It's the SMB service for file sharing.

102
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,050
Well, you could then mitigate this

103
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,810
by blocking that port at your
network boundary's firewall

104
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,480
as a compensating control.

105
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,320
It's still going to have a
vulnerability for people inside,

106
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,440
but you're going to stop the attackers

107
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,170
from the outside of getting in.

108
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,110
That's the idea here as
you start figuring out

109
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,180
how you're going to solve
your vulnerabilities.

110
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,710
Now the point is you're going
to have many different choices

111
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,890
for mitigation, but your
strategy is going to help you

112
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,130
determine how you're going
to solve these problems

113
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,950
because you only have different things.

114
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,990
If I'm more worried about inside threat,

115
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,650
stopping it at the network
firewall isn't going to help,

116
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,110
but if I'm worried about
outside threats, it would.

117
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,730
So by answering these three questions,

118
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,000
you're going to be able to better scope

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,470
your vulnerability assessments
to be more targeted

120
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,380
and better address the issues you identify

121
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,590
during your vulnerability assessments.

122
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,460
So how is a vulnerability
assessment even conducted?

123
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,370
Well, most commonly, a
vulnerability management program

124
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,030
will be used inside of an organization

125
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,200
and they'll choose what
software you're going to use.

126
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,220
Generally, the software
will be centrally managed

127
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,880
and perform these vulnerability
assessments and scans.

128
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,750
Common choices for scanning
include things like Nessus,

129
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,270
Qualysguard, and AlienVault software.

130
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,840
Luckily though, you
don't have to be familiar

131
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,460
with any of these tools in detail

132
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,420
for the Security+ Exam.

133
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,290
Now when you use these programs,

134
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,280
analysts are able to scan the
network based on the scope

135
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,530
and they can determine the priority

136
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,340
they're going to use
when they find issues,

137
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,120
such as missing patches
and misconfigurations.

138
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,220
These are then reported up

139
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,810
through the organizational process

140
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,050
to your system administrators

141
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,550
who will then patch and reconfigure them.

142
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,600
Once these are corrected
by the system admins,

143
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,960
you then want to go back
and re-scan the network

144
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,270
to determine if the issue
was really resolved.

145
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,590
Did that security patch
really patch the vulnerability

146
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,110
you thought it was going to?

147
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,803
It's important to note that
vulnerability assessments

148
00:05:06,803 --> 00:05:09,020
are just a snapshot in time.

149
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,920
For example, if I scan today

150
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,490
and a new vulnerability
is discovered tomorrow,

151
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,090
then I'm not protected against
it, I never looked for it.

152
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,360
So if your organization
is doing a monthly scan

153
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,750
and a patch cycle that way,

154
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,190
your network may have an issue

155
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,530
that you're not even aware of

156
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,700
for up to an entire month
until the next scan.

157
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,750
And if the issue is identified

158
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,260
and the system administrator
installed the patch improperly,

159
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,820
it could take you another month

160
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,270
before it's discovered in
the next periodic scan.

161
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,790
So determining how frequently
you want to do these scans

162
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,870
is really important to your security.

163
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,610
Now to summarize the
vulnerability management process

164
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,930
in just five steps,

165
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,070
here's the basic concepts
you need to know.

166
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,190
Step one, define the
desired state of security.

167
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,180
Your organization should determine exactly

168
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,370
how safe it wants to be and
that determines how much money,

169
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,520
time and resources are going to be spent

170
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,990
to dedicate to the vulnerability
management program.

171
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,560
After all, you're not going to
be able to stop every threat

172
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,440
and you can't protect yourself
from everything equally.

173
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,710
Step two, create a baseline.

174
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,520
You need to understand what normal is

175
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,870
and what the current
state of your systems is.

176
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,690
Back in step one, we're going to
determine where we want to be,

177
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,950
what our goal is.

178
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,670
Here in step two, we need to determine

179
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,233
where we currently are
in terms of security.

180
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:20,650
This brings us to step three,

181
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,730
prioritize the vulnerabilities.

182
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,420
You might run your first
scan of the network

183
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,640
and find 150 different issues.

184
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,440
If you're the only security analyst,

185
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,053
which one should you fix first?

186
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:31,910
Well, this is why it's important

187
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,740
to prioritize your strategy.

188
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,780
I recommend fixing servers
first over work stations

189
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,360
and more critical issues
like a remote code execution

190
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,110
over more trivial vulnerability

191
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,950
like an ability to conduct
a null session connection.

192
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,750
This is because servers hold
lots of critical information,

193
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,010
and critical vulnerabilities
should always be addressed

194
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,860
before lower risk items.

195
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,420
Step four, you want to
mitigate vulnerabilities.

196
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,440
This is where you're
actually going to install

197
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,030
all those different controls,
install those patches,

198
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,370
do your change configurations

199
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,240
to make your systems more secure.

200
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,830
In step three, we prioritize,

201
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,790
in step four, we actually
put those things into place.

202
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,770
And that brings us to step five,

203
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,760
monitor the network and systems
and conduct future scans.

204
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,240
You now have a bunch of issues

205
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,140
you hopefully fixed or
mitigated all of those issues,

206
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,070
and now we want to watch and
ensure nothing bad happens.

207
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,440
Or maybe some of those things

208
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,710
are going to take months to fix

209
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,720
because you need more money

210
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,070
to buy a new server or
a new operating system.

211
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,510
If that's the case, you need
to monitor those servers

212
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,380
until you get them patched and fixed.

213
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,220
Your job is not done with just scanning.

214
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,130
You need to scan and follow through,

215
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,180
and then start scanning again.

216
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,070
Remember, scan, patch, scan
over and over and over again.

217
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,710
Our work is never done

218
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,930
because new vulnerabilities are
discovered every single day.

219
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,030
The good news about that

220
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,630
is it means you're going
to have great job security

221
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,470
because we always are going to have a job

222
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,842
for people doing vulnerability assessment.

223
