1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,670
- There are a lot of ways to
store data in your network

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,270
and on your computers.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,440
In addition to your internal hard drive,

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,960
most computers have the ability

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,440
to use removable media as well.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,600
Removable media comes in
many different formats.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,480
In the old days, we had
our simple floppy disks.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,550
Then we moved up to CDs and then DVDs

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,790
and those held a lot more information.

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,380
Next, we had external hard
drives that plug in through USB.

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,750
And finally, we had USB thumb sticks

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,300
which are very small but
hold a ton of information.

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,580
When you're placing your information

14
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,700
onto one of these removable media formats

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,170
or external devices,

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,480
you have to make sure that it
stays safe from prying eyes.

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,810
We want to ensure confidentiality.

18
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,860
To do this, we always
want to encrypt our files.

19
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,070
You can do this in one of two ways.

20
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,870
On Windows 10, you can use BitLocker To Go

21
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,420
which will allow you to encrypt files

22
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,320
using a software encryption.

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,700
Also, you could buy a USB thumb stick

24
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,960
that already has hardware
encryption built-in,

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,970
something like an IronKey USB shown here.

26
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,520
Some organizations are a
little more paranoid though

27
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,450
and they want to ensure

28
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,650
that nothing gets out
of their organization.

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,610
And they also want to make sure

30
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,950
that nothing gets into their organization.

31
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,650
To do that, they've implemented
removable media controls.

32
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,880
These controls are technical limitations

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,110
that are placed on a system

34
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,740
in regards to the way
the USB storage devices

35
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,210
and other media can be accessed.

36
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,200
For example, this can be
done using technical controls

37
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,950
inside your group policies

38
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,640
by denying read access from USB drives

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,110
or denying write access to a CD or DVD.

40
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,140
In addition to these technical controls,

41
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,820
you also need to consider
which administrative controls

42
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,020
such as policies you want to create

43
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,620
and guide those technical
controls that are going to be used

44
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,670
inside your organization.

45
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,770
In addition to external
devices and removable media,

46
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,160
we also can store our data on our networks

47
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,720
and we might do something called a NAS.

48
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,270
If we use a NAS, that's a
Network Attached Storage device.

49
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,260
These storage devices connect directly

50
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,240
into your organization's network.

51
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,440
They often look like a
big rack of hard drives

52
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,870
with a network cable coming
out of the back of them.

53
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,020
Most of the time,

54
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,520
NAS systems are going to implement
some form of a RAID array

55
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,720
that gives you high availability.

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,750
Because these devices need
to be accessed at all times

57
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,210
because they're acting as file servers

58
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,370
for your organization,

59
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,770
this high availability is important.

60
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,100
Oftentimes, we'll take different NAS'

61
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,520
and we'll connect them together

62
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,340
into what's known as a
Storage Area Network or a SAN.

63
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,960
A SAN is a network designed

64
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,570
specifically to perform
block storage functions

65
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,550
and it may consist of many NAS
devices connected together.

66
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,780
Now if you're using a single NAS device

67
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,130
in your organization or at your home,

68
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,890
there are three tips I want to give you

69
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,150
to make sure that you secure it properly.

70
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,940
First, always use data encryption.

71
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,360
If your NAS supports full
disk data encryption,

72
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,530
you should turn it on and implement it.

73
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,760
Second, you should always
use proper authentication.

74
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,000
These things are acting as file servers.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,040
You want to make sure that
it asks for credentials

76
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,720
such as a username and password

77
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,340
and that is individualized to each user

78
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,730
so no one is sharing access
across the organization.

79
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,140
The third thing is to make
sure you're logging access

80
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,740
to your NAS device.

81
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,700
This way if something goes wrong,

82
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,080
you can go back and figure out

83
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,500
who was the last person
who accessed the NAS?

84
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,480
Who downloaded those hundred
terabytes worth of files?

85
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,620
And what may have gone wrong?

86
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,030
These are important things
to know and without logs,

87
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,780
you won't be able to figure it out.
