1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,710
- So in the auditing lesson,

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,520
I mentioned logs and how
they're very tied together.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,500
In this lesson, we're going
to focus on logs specifically.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,620
Now, logs are simply
data files that contain

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,949
the accounting and audit trails

6
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:12,782
for actions performed by a user

7
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:14,740
on the computer or on the network.

8
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,430
That's why logs are really helpful

9
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,870
when we're doing auditing because it tells

10
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,120
us exactly what has been done
and what has not been done.

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,210
Now, on the screen here,

12
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,110
you can see a listing of log files

13
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,850
that exist on a Lynx System

14
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,090
and they're stored in
the /var/log directory.

15
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,220
Now, you can see there are logs

16
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,690
for the kernels actions,
the SYSLOG server,

17
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,130
samba file shares and much more.

18
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,560
You don't need to know all of these

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,820
specific log files for the exam.

20
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,210
This is just an example,
to give you an experience

21
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,980
and see that there are
logs on a Lynx System.

22
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,940
If you're looking for the
logs on a Lynx System,

23
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,920
check the /var/log directory.

24
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,420
Now when we talk about
this on a Windows System,

25
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,633
there are three types of logs

26
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:54,340
that you have to be familiar with.

27
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,310
There are Security, System
and Application logs

28
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,440
and all three of those should be audited

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,320
when you're looking at a Windows System.

30
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,630
Now, Security Logs are logs for events

31
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,400
such as successful and unsuccessful

32
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,340
user logons to the system.

33
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,887
You might get a question
on the exam that asks you

34
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:11,767
"If you are trying to find when a user

35
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,207
"was successfully logged onto a system,

36
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,590
"which log would you look at?"

37
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,640
And they'll ask you Security,
Application or System log

38
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,680
and you have to know
that it's a Security log.

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,930
Now if we look at a
System Log for instance,

40
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,260
these are logs that have events

41
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,710
such as a system shutdown
or driver failure.

42
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,670
So if you're trying to
investigate why that computer

43
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,020
or server was shut down at midnight,

44
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,770
you can go into the System
Log and hopefully find out.

45
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,430
Now if you're having a
problem with an application,

46
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,460
you're going to look at
the Application Logs.

47
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,410
Application Logs are
going to log the events

48
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,570
for the operating system
and third-party applications

49
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,030
and so those are the three types of logs

50
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,490
you need to be aware of inside of Windows.

51
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,140
Now in Windows, if you want
to view these log files

52
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,130
you're going to use the Event Viewer.

53
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,860
Some logs like the System,
Security and the Application logs

54
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,560
are going to exists on both
work stations and servers.

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,720
If you're on a service though,

56
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,020
there's a lot of other logs
that are going to exist too

57
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,853
Things like,

58
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:03,140
the Distributed File System
Replication Services,

59
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,430
DNS servers, DHCP Servers,

60
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,520
Directory service logs
and many many others.

61
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,680
All of these can be accessed
from the Event Viewer,

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,730
but the Event Viewer isn't the most

63
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,090
efficient way to view them.

64
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,830
In fact, I much prefer a SYSLOG Server.

65
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,110
This will allow you to consolidate

66
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,980
all of the logs into a single repository

67
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,980
and then you can use a SYSLOG Client

68
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,360
to read through them
and help cor alate them.

69
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,870
So if I need to cor alate an issue

70
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,170
with the DHCP and the DNS Server,

71
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,020
being able to do that through

72
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,283
the SYSLOG Server is much more efficient.

73
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,790
SYSLOG is simply a standardized format

74
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,310
for computer message logging,

75
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,220
that allows the separation of the software

76
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,830
that generates the message,
the system that stores them

77
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,360
and the software that
reports and analyzes them.

78
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,920
What does that really all mean?

79
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,540
Well, when it comes to SYSLOG Servers,

80
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,410
I can actually have different servers,

81
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,970
around the world, all
sending their log files

82
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,380
back to a single logging server.

83
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,120
So the DNS Server, the DHCP Server,

84
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,000
the authentication server
and your client work station

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,240
can all send their logs back

86
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,300
to a centralized monitoring system,

87
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,820
known as a SYSLOG Server.

88
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,640
It'll collect all those logs
from across the enterprise,

89
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,600
cor alate them in the central repository

90
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,160
and make it so that I can actually

91
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,220
look up all of those things

92
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,210
based off of a SYSLOG client.

93
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,460
By taking apart the message format,

94
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,040
the person who's sending the message

95
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,540
and the client that reads those messages,

96
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,750
it allows us to have a lot more capability

97
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,740
than looking at the single event viewer

98
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,400
on a single Windows server

99
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,200
and having to log into
each server to do that.

100
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,370
SYSLOG does this by
sending all of that data

101
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,900
back over UDP using port 5-1-4.

102
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,910
And you might remember that

103
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,493
from our protocol lesson
earlier in the course.
