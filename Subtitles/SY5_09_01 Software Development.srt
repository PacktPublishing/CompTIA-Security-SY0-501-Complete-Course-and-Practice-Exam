1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,040
- In this section of the course,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,400
we're going to talk about
software development.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,960
When a piece of software is created,

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,140
it requires a lot of work.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,800
Each and every function that's
performed by that software

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,730
has to be written to be able
to do its intended role.

7
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,240
This often requires the work
of dozens of programmers

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,920
and hundreds of thousands
of lines of code.

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,730
Often, when a bug is found
in a piece of software,

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,360
I hear people ask why that
company didn't figure it out

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,300
before the software was released.

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,790
Well, there's lots of different ways

13
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,250
to conduct software testing,

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,710
and we're going to talk about
them later on in the section.

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,220
But bugs are still going
to find their way into code

16
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,230
because our software is
so complex these days.

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,170
Let's take, for example, the
Windows 10 operating system.

18
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,190
It consists of over 50
million lines of code

19
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,920
and took the involvement of hundreds

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,420
of different programmers.

21
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,800
With that much complexity,
there's always a chance

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,650
that an error is going to be
introduced into the code base.

23
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,540
Now, to try and counteract the complexity

24
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,548
of our software development,

25
00:00:54,548 --> 00:00:57,550
many models and methods
have been introduced,

26
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,040
the most common of which is known

27
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,600
as the software development
life cycle or SLDC.

28
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,370
The software development life
cycle is an organized process

29
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,780
of developing a secure
software application

30
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,440
throughout its life cycle
throughout the project.

31
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,662
This process covers everything

32
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:13,710
from the initial idea of the software,

33
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,360
through its coding and testing,

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,320
and even into its
deployment and retirement.

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,690
The software development life cycle

36
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,560
is based on a generic
Waterfall model of development.

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,900
Each phase of a life cycle

38
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,350
is broken down into smaller portions.

39
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,010
As each one is finished,
the next one has begun.

40
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,110
The reason this model
is termed the Waterfall

41
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,630
is that information and
the software product itself

42
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,940
flows from the top stage all the way down

43
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,140
to the bottom stage,
getting more developed

44
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,920
as it progresses downward.

45
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,790
Visually, this looks like a waterfall,

46
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,030
as shown in this example on the screen.

47
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,690
Different organizations use
different phases or stages

48
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,120
as part of their software
development life cycle though,

49
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,180
but for the CompTIA Security+ exam,

50
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,580
you need to know the seven
phases as CompTIA defines them.

51
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,150
Now, let's cover each
of theses seven phases.

52
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,710
The first phase is planning and analysis.

53
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,080
During this stage, the goals
of the software project

54
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,730
are determined, the
stakeholder needs are assessed,

55
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,500
and all of the high level
planning work is conducted.

56
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,210
Essentially, this is where things go

57
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,625
from a rough idea that someone
had for a piece of software

58
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,750
into a bit more formalized
and well developed concept

59
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,360
that we can plan the rest of
our development cycle against.

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,876
Once all the requirements
have been gathered,

61
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:20,420
we can move into the phase

62
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,010
that's known as software
or systems design.

63
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,840
It's during this stage
that the application

64
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,550
or system is defined, outlined,
and diagrammed in detail.

65
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,210
Essentially, this is where we focus

66
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,050
on the overarching inputs
and outputs of each function

67
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,890
that are going to make
up the final software

68
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,900
that's going to be
released to our customer.

69
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,580
At this point, we still haven't created

70
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,234
any programming code though.

71
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:42,270
This brings us to the third phase,

72
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,230
which is called implementation.

73
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,690
During implementation,
programmers will begin to code

74
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,010
all of the various functions

75
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,970
that are needed for the final product.

76
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,870
As each piece of the code is developed,

77
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,840
the programmers will conduct

78
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,540
some basic debugging and testing

79
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,000
to ensure that its functionality
is working properly.

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,270
But, at this point,

81
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,290
there's been no formal
testing completed yet.

82
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,690
The fourth phase is reserved

83
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,170
for that formalized
testing of the application.

84
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,030
It's during this phase
that we get the code

85
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,610
and we check it through a myriad

86
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,700
of different testing methodologies.

87
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,240
We're going to spend an entire lesson

88
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,690
on those testing methodologies
later on in this section.

89
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,160
Once the testing is complete,

90
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,150
the integration phase will begin.

91
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,310
During this phase, the
application or system

92
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,030
is integrated into the
larger network environment.

93
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,190
Whereas in phase four,

94
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,260
we focused on testing the
individual application or system,

95
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,234
in phase five, the integration phase,

96
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:32,770
we're focused on testing
the end-to-end service

97
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,250
to ensure that all of the
pieces and all of the parts

98
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,220
can communicate effectively and correctly.

99
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,970
For example, if you finish developing

100
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,330
a new software application
to provide quiz questions

101
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,990
to your students through the website,

102
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,000
now you have to make sure

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,620
that you integrate that quiz application

104
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,050
into the web server, the
databases that hold the questions,

105
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,110
the network connectivity,
and everything else

106
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,190
that connects your server
to the outside world.

107
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,620
Connecting these different applications

108
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,890
and systems together is
known as integration.

109
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,290
The sixth phase is known as deployment.

110
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,390
During deployment, your
application or system

111
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,440
will be moved into the
production environment

112
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,470
where your customers and your end users

113
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,810
can now utilize it to perform their work.

114
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,107
In the example of Windows 10,

115
00:04:12,107 --> 00:04:15,160
deployment occurred when it
was installed on a new PC

116
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,210
or it was downloaded
from Microsoft's website

117
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:20,250
to upgrade your current
Windows 8.1 workstation.

118
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,570
This is the phase that
allows real work to be done

119
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,100
using your new software applications.

120
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,840
The seventh and final phase
is called maintenance.

121
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,556
As I stated at the
beginning of this lecture,

122
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:32,710
software bugs and
vulnerabilities do happen.

123
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,140
This means that, once your product

124
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,600
is released into deployment,

125
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,643
your work is still not finished.

126
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:40,631
Instead, the programmers are
now focused on bug fixes,

127
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:43,410
patches, and updates to
the version of the software

128
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,000
that you're going to end up using.

129
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,310
Additionally, your
organizational service desk

130
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,490
is now focused on helping your end users

131
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,680
to understand how to
properly use this program

132
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,700
more efficiently and effectively.

133
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,251
This is another piece of the
larger ongoing maintenance

134
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:57,840
that an organization will do

135
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,980
as part of its software
development life cycle.

136
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,000
When we discuss maintenance
of the software,

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,570
two very important concepts
are version control

138
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,330
and configuration management.

139
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,890
This will ensure that, as you update

140
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,240
or fix a problem in
your baseline software,

141
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,606
you have a way to identify
what is the newest version

142
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:14,940
and what is the older version.

143
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,500
Often, this is done
using a numbering scheme

144
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,960
that consists of major, minor,
and build version numbers.

145
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,890
For example, if you're
running Windows 10.0.12425,

146
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,260
that shows up as a major version 10,

147
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,890
a minor version 0, and
a build number of 12425.

148
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,160
Eventually, this software
will become outdated and old

149
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,020
and it will have to be retired.

150
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,500
Under the CompTIA model,
this is also considered

151
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,050
part of that seventh
phase called maintenance.

152
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,000
In other SDLC models through,

153
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,890
retirement is often
considered its own phase.

154
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,040
For example, Windows XP is considered

155
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,800
a piece of unsupported or retired software

156
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,330
because it's no longer
supported by Microsoft.

157
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,530
Therefore, if your organization
is running Windows XP still,

158
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,120
you need to develop a retirement plan

159
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,900
to migrate your current
business functions and processes

160
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,000
off of those Windows XP workstations

161
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,490
and into a more modern and
supported version of Windows,

162
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,020
like Windows 10.

163
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,540
Now, the Waterfall model
works great for projects

164
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,870
that are very complex,
and they also are great

165
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,200
for things that need
high levels of security.

166
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,033
This is accomplished

167
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,620
through that testing that we talked about.

168
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,000
But this does take up a lot of time

169
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,380
and it doesn't support rapid
development or rapid changes.

170
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,610
For example, under a
Waterfall development,

171
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,200
it can take six to 12 months

172
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,930
to get from the first planning phase

173
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,390
all the way through to deployment

174
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,350
and maintenance in the seventh phase.

175
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,539
Any changes in your requirements

176
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:37,410
would require us to go
back to an earlier stage

177
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,710
and continue down that Waterfall again.

178
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,989
In a strict Waterfall scenario,

179
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:43,360
you wouldn't even be able
to add additional features

180
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,010
until the initial product
was already delivered.

181
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,110
This means you're going to have
to wait for the next version

182
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,850
to release those and get those changes out

183
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,290
to your end users.

184
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,970
In response to this, a different
way of software development

185
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,330
has risen in popularity.

186
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,189
This is known as Agile development.

187
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:59,300
Agile software development is performed

188
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,227
in time-boxed or small increments

189
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:04,550
to allow it to be more adaptive
to changing requirements.

190
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,010
In Agile, we still
perform most of the phases

191
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,720
that make up the Waterfall model,

192
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,940
but the big difference is we
do them much, much quicker.

193
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,420
For example, many Agile
development projects

194
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,230
work in either a two-week
or a four-week time period

195
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,770
known as a sprint.

196
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,339
The goal in Agile is to release
smaller product portions

197
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:23,400
more quickly and more often,

198
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,660
and at the end of every sprint,

199
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,240
something has to be released.

200
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,130
In a Waterfall model, for example,

201
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,320
we might be trying to release
and entire operating system

202
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,689
like Windows 10, but in
Agile, we would release

203
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:35,610
just three or four features
in this two-week period,

204
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,300
and then, we'd add another few features

205
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,620
for the next two-week period,

206
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,239
and we'll continually add small pieces

207
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:42,688
until we provide the additional
functionality we want

208
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:45,660
all along the way for this final product.

209
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,990
For the Security+ exam,

210
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,060
you don't need to know Agile in depth.

211
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,280
If you really want to dig
into Agile project management

212
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,430
and development though, I
would recommend watching

213
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,920
our course on PRINCE2 Agile Foundation,

214
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,520
which is an excellent certification
for Agile development.

215
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,550
This will give you a great primer

216
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,530
on using many different types
of Agile development methods

217
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,350
when doing software or other
highly adaptable projects.

218
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,380
The final term that I wanted
to cover in this lesson

219
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,560
is known as DevOps.

220
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,330
DevOps is a term created
from the words development

221
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,670
and operations.

222
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,130
This is a way of conducting business

223
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,350
where the software developers

224
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,813
an the IT operations personnel

225
00:08:16,813 --> 00:08:19,360
work closely together to
speed up the development

226
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,070
and deployment of the applications

227
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,489
and to get things out
to the end user quicker.

228
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:25,470
Because of the reduced timeline,

229
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,688
it's a good idea to embed
a security-minded person

230
00:08:26,688 --> 00:08:29,840
into the DevOps team as well

231
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,424
to ensure that good
cybersecurity is not sacrificed

232
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:35,361
in an effort to get the
product out quicker.

233
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:37,726
(vibrating music)
