1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,710
- SSH or Secure Shell is

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,620
another protocol that we often use

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,850
to tunnel other protocols through.

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,470
Secure Shell is a protocol

5
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,830
that we can create a secure channel

6
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,090
between two computers or network devices

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,650
and this allows one device

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,970
to actually take control
over another device.

9
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,940
So if I wanted to connect
my laptop to a server

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,940
so that I can do remote
execution of commands

11
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,380
as a system administrator,

12
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,580
I would use Secure Shell to do that.

13
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,400
Basically, Secure Shell was designed

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,660
as a replacement for Telnet

15
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,120
because Telnet, we've
already said, is bad.

16
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,700
Telnet sends everything in
the clear and unencrypted.

17
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,820
SSH on the other-hand, allows us to have

18
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,474
this nice encrypted tunnel
that protects our data.

19
00:00:36,474 --> 00:00:39,300
SSH was originally used in Unix and Linux,

20
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,850
but now, you're finding
it in Windows as well.

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,310
It is very heavily used

22
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,690
as a text based remote control method

23
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,930
for anything that you need
to be able to get into

24
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,180
and do remote control of.

25
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,570
Things like routers and switches,

26
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,840
you Telnet into them

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,910
to get to their command-line

28
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,510
and be able to set up commands.

29
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,380
Same thing you can do
that for a Windows server

30
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,450
or to a Linux or a Unix server.

31
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,920
SSH is going to require
that you have two things.

32
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,280
You have to have a server
which is known as a daemon

33
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,500
that can be run on once device

34
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,750
and then you have a client
on the second device.

35
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,740
So on my laptop, I have an SSH client

36
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,850
and I connect in to the
server daemon that I can then

37
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,040
take control of that server

38
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,840
and do what I need to do with it.

39
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,440
Now, when we talk about SSH,

40
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,500
it operates over port 22.

41
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,600
And you may remember that from our

42
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,260
ports and protocol lesson.

43
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,750
Now, we also talked about the fact

44
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,890
that secure copy and secure FTP

45
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,830
also operate over port 22.

46
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,930
Now why is that?

47
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,690
Well, it's because secure
copy and secure FTP or SFTP

48
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,370
both operate in an SSH
tunnel to be able to operate

49
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,660
and that's what gives them their security.

50
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,330
Another great thing about SSH

51
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,160
is that you can use
public key cryptography

52
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,610
to secure its connections.

53
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,790
So just like we created a TLS tunnel,

54
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,050
we can do the same thing but using SSH.

55
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,940
Now when we talk about SSH,

56
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,350
there's a couple of versions of it.

57
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,560
There was version 1, version
1.5 and then version 2

58
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,180
are the three big ones out there.

59
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,740
The earlier versions, version 1 and 1.5,

60
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,400
had issues with unauthorized
insertion of content,

61
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,520
improper forwarding of those

62
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,300
secure connections to other servers

63
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,140
and integer overflow issues.

64
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,870
But all of that was fixed thankfully,

65
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,870
in SSH version 2.

66
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,700
Version 2 also added Diffie-Hellman

67
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,500
for secure key exchanges
and the use of MACs,

68
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
which are Message Authentication Codes

69
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,160
and this provides us
integrity checking of the data

70
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,200
as it's being transferred
over the network.

71
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,620
This makes SSH a great tool for us

72
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,720
and something that we heavily, heavily use

73
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,420
as security administrators
and network administrators.

74
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:31,001
(electronic crackling)
