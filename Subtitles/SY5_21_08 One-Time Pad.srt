1
00:00:00,411 --> 00:00:02,870
- Every encryption cipher
is attempting to do

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,480
one basic function.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,970
We're trying to assure you
that confidentiality exists

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,580
in the data they've encrypted.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,080
But, no encryption cipher
is truly unbreakable.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,870
Given enough time and
computer processing power

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,520
any encryption can be defeated,

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,810
including AES, DES and
many others, eventually.

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,560
Well, that is all of them except one.

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,190
This is called a One-Time Pad.

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,470
Now, a One-Time Pad is a stream cipher

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,460
that encrypts plaintext information

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,080
with a secret random key
that is the same length

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,750
as the plaintext input.

15
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,350
This secret random key
is knows as a keystream

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,020
and it's comprised of a
series of random bits.

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,250
If the keystream is truly random,

18
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,550
the only way an attacker
could decrypt the information

19
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,020
back to the plaintext
is if they had access

20
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,290
to that randomly created keystream.

21
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,110
To describe how this works a little bit,

22
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,010
let's do a lo-tech version of this.

23
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,630
Let's say that you and
I both wanted to come up

24
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,980
with a secret code so that we can

25
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,320
transmit information to each other

26
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,600
and nobody else in the world
would be able to know it.

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,140
The way we can do this is
by using a One-Time Pad.

28
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,880
We'll each buy a thousand-page
notebook and on every page,

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,240
we're going to put a
number on there, at random.

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,570
And your book and my
book are going to match.

31
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,270
So, for everyone of those thousand pages,

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,670
there's a random number on it.

33
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,230
So, now every time we want to
send a message to each other,

34
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,410
we're going to perform
a rotation cipher on it.

35
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,290
And so, if I wanted to send
you the word "Hi", H-I,

36
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,810
then I'm going to rotate the h

37
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,330
by the number on the
first page, which is 3.

38
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,850
So instead of h, it would be h, i, j, k.

39
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,160
So I'd put a k down.

40
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,730
And then I would rotate the i,

41
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,630
the second letter in my word,

42
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,560
based on the second page of our notebook,

43
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,970
in this case, zero.

44
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,100
So now I'm going to have K-I,

45
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,530
and send you that message.

46
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,120
Because you have the same notebook,

47
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,392
you can then subtract
three from the k to get h,

48
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:46,770
and zero from the i to get i,

49
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,320
and you know the message is "Hi".

50
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,650
But anybody else in the world,

51
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,320
wouldn't be able to know what it was.

52
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,869
Now once we use those
pages, we rip them out,

53
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:55,810
we burn them, and we never use them again.

54
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,340
Because this is truly a random key string,

55
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,430
and no one would be able
to decrypt our messages

56
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,770
if they don't have that
random number string

57
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,070
written down like we do.

58
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,660
The reason is, there was no
real mathematical formula

59
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,210
or pattern to determine here.

60
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,050
If I use the same number
for the entire message,

61
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,020
we can use cryptoanalysis and figure out

62
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,470
that all of the letters will move

63
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,560
by five, or 10, or 13,

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,860
but by changing every single number,

65
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,150
or in the data stream, every single bit,

66
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,470
there's no pattern.

67
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,630
So they're only going to be
able to decode that message

68
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,220
if they're able to get a copy
of our one-time use pads.

69
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,150
Now there is one problem
with a one-time pad though,

70
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,530
and it's that there is not such thing

71
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,610
as a truly random sequence of numbers

72
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,690
if those numbers are
created by a computer.

73
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,220
Computer aren't random.

74
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,100
They're based on math and algorithms.

75
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,210
And so, computers can't simply create

76
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,630
purely random numbers.

77
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,330
Instead, they try to simulate
it, using algorithms,

78
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,780
and they try to create what's known

79
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,420
as a Pseudo-Random Number
Generator, or PRNG.

80
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,450
This is an algorithm that
spits out what looks,

81
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,320
to you and me, like random numbers,

82
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,410
but to other computers,
they can figure out

83
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,730
what the initial seed was

84
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,270
and then that takes away the randomness.

85
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,670
These numbers are used
for a variety of purposes,

86
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,330
including encryption, as
well as game development

87
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,110
and other things that you
might need a random number for.

88
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,640
For example, you may wish
to have images uploaded

89
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,110
by your users and assign a random filename

90
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,860
made out of a series of numbers.

91
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,290
In truth, though, the
numbers aren't purely random,

92
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,820
because computer create them based

93
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,380
on mathematical functions.

94
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,670
Or, you may need to generate
a unique session key

95
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,440
to identify a user, and this would be

96
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,870
an appropriate place to
use a pseudo-random number.

97
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,010
But, if someone can
figure out the sequence

98
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,790
of pseudo-random numbers you're using,

99
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,130
they can guess the next session,

100
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,010
and do a session hijack.

101
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,110
Going back to our
one-time use pad, though,

102
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,040
if we could create the truly
random sequence of numbers

103
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,440
then we could securely exchange
the information contained

104
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,540
in that one-time use pad
and then we would have

105
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,130
a truly unbreakable encryption cipher.

106
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,304
Unfortunately, though,
we don't have a truly

107
00:03:47,304 --> 00:03:50,320
random sequence of numbers
that we can rely on.

108
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,735
So one-time pads aren't often used.

109
00:03:52,735 --> 00:03:56,630
Instead, we use the concept
on one-time use passwords.

110
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,090
You've seen this discussed inside

111
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,320
our multi-fact authentication lesson.

112
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,440
For example, you could use a random number

113
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,160
that's texted to you by your website

114
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,810
whenever you attempt to log in.

115
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,990
Or, you might have an RSA secure token

116
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,640
that displays pseudo-random numbers

117
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,490
that you use to prove you have possession

118
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,280
of that token as your second
fact of authentication.

119
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,310
These are two good
examples of where we use

120
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,003
pseudo-random numbers in
the security of our network.
