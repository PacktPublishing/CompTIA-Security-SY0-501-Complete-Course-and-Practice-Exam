00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,800
- Spoofing, spoofing is a
category of network attacks

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,640
that occur when an attacker masquerades

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,510
as another person by
falsifying their identity.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,990
Just like a person uses a mask

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,290
to cover up their face to
hide their true identity,

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,740
spoofing is the electronic equivalent.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,190
We have briefly discussed
spoofing a few times already,

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,870
such as in the case of the
DNS amplification attack

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,950
when attempting a
distributed denial of service

10
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,560
by spoofing the IP address
of the victim's server

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,980
when making that request.

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,270
Or we've talked about it before

13
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,400
when we talked about fishing,

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,550
where an attacker is trying to get you

15
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,970
to click on a link in an email

16
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,960
by falsifying their identity to trick you

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,500
into clicking that link
thinking that it's trusted.

18
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,680
Anything that identifies a user or system

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,100
can be spoofed, though.

20
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,180
For example, each network interface card

21
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,700
has a unique MAC address
that's assigned to it,

22
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,640
but MAC spoofing allows the attacker

23
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,460
to change their MAC address to pretend

24
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,430
that they're using a different device.

25
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,430
IP addresses are also commonly
used to identify a system,

26
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,610
but with IP spoofing, the attacker can use

27
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,480
somebody else's IP address
as part of their attacks.

28
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,170
So, how do we prevent spoofing

29
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,670
from being effectively
used against our systems?

30
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,380
Well, the best way is to
proper authentication,

31
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,300
preferably multi-factor.

32
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,150
Now when you use proper authentication,

33
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,690
you're going to be able
to identify a system

34
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,630
or user more accurately
and prevent the spoofing.

35
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,780
If you can do this,
you're going to be able

36
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,688
to detect and stop spoofing quite easily.

37
00:01:16,688 --> 00:01:19,023
(electronic tones)
