1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,210
- In this demonstration,
we're going to explore

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,520
a basic small office, home
office network firewall.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,870
In this example, I'm going
to use a typical router

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,330
switch access point combination device

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,450
manufactured by Netgear and marketed

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,110
as a wireless router N300 model.

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,550
Now, this is probably very similar

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,640
to what most of you are using

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,330
in your small office or
home office environments.

10
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,450
Your interface and
settings on your firewall

11
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,070
are going to look a little
different than mine,

12
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,230
but it's still going to give
you the same general idea

13
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,610
of what kind of options there are

14
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,650
and how you can configure
one of these firewalls

15
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,530
at your network boundary.

16
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,700
So, on the screen you can see the basic

17
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,670
web-based access for this wireless router,

18
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,170
wireless access point combination device.

19
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,330
Now, on mine, I'm going to go to security,

20
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,200
which is where the firewall is located

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,090
and it's under block services

22
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,800
on this particular router.

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,450
Now, usually, most of these small office,

24
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,230
home office routers are
going to have a very

25
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,410
weak type firewall and they hide it

26
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,530
by calling it something else

27
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,260
instead of calling it a firewall.

28
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,670
So, it'll be called block sites,

29
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,760
block services, block ports,
something of that nature.

30
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,600
So in this case, it's block services

31
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,450
and I can do it based on a schedule

32
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,440
so I only want it to be done

33
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,960
at certain times in the day or always.

34
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,960
Let's say I want to block
something like Telnet.

35
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,330
I'm going to always block
it, I'm going to add a block,

36
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,270
and the block I want to use
is going to be a service,

37
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,110
and go down to Telnet.

38
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,890
Now, it automatically knows
that Telnet is port 23,

39
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,920
so it's going to block port 23 for me.

40
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,680
It's called Telnet because
this is a pre-defined one,

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,760
and then I can block
it for all IP addresses

42
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,380
in this network, or only
certain IP addresses

43
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,960
or a certain range.

44
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,290
So, maybe I want to block it
for everything for Telnet.

45
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,910
That's fine, we can go ahead
and add that to our list.

46
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,160
Now, if we want to add something else.

47
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,620
Let's say I have another rule.

48
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,380
In this case, I want to block port 666

49
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,470
because maybe there's a game

50
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,270
I don't want my kids playing on that.

51
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,440
So, I'll block it as port 666.

52
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,800
I'm going to make it TCP, UDP, or both.

53
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,330
I'm going to say both in this case.

54
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,610
And I'm just going to call it game.

55
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,860
And then I can block it for an IP range.

56
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,730
Maybe I don't want it to
be accessed by my kids,

57
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,237
which all have their
devices in the 10.0.0.2

58
00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:04,610
and 10.0.0.10 range.

59
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,730
If I do that, I can go ahead and hit add,

60
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,310
and again that adds another
rule to the firewall

61
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,310
where we are blocking port
666 over that range of IPs.

62
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,710
Now you can see how this works

63
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,260
as you can add or delete different rules.

64
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,850
Then I can go through
and I can do another one.

65
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,850
Let's say I want to block the ftp server.

66
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,320
So, I will just go through here,

67
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,980
and say user defined,
port 20 through port 21

68
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,390
because that is the connection port

69
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,590
and the data ports for ftp.

70
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,813
And then we'll give it a name of ftp.

71
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,890
And we can do it for all IP addresses

72
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,120
in this range so nobody
can access ftp server.

73
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,650
That's the idea of how
this firewall works.

74
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,820
And you can do it, in
this case, it's blocking

75
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,360
the outbound connections
because it's preventing

76
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,240
us from sending things
out to the internet.

77
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,310
Now, if we want to block
things from coming in

78
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,290
from the internet, we're
going to have to do that

79
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,990
in a different firewall
on this particular device

80
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,940
because this one only has
the outbound defined here.

81
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,760
It's going to have what
things as it's going out

82
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,050
to the internet.

83
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,720
Now, if I want to do
this on inbound stuff,

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,140
I would have to go and find that

85
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,560
in this particular router.

86
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,780
That's usually going to be something like

87
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,590
port forwarding or port triggering

88
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,880
or something like a static route.

89
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,700
And so in this case, I can
port forward or port trigger

90
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,480
and say hey if something's
trying to come in

91
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,480
on port 21, ftp, it can go
and be routed to my server

92
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,350
which is at the .50, for instance.

93
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,430
And so now, anything that
comes in that's trying

94
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,770
to get to this router on port 21,

95
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,940
is going to be forwarded over
to that IP address of .50.

96
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,490
So that's how you allow
things in to your network

97
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,810
based on this particular firewall.

98
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,100
Now, how do you block
things at the firewall?

99
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,830
Well, in this particular router,

100
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,350
everything is blocked by default

101
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,450
because it's doing an implicit deny.

102
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,960
So anytime I add a rule like ftp here,

103
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,450
that's doing an explicit allow

104
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,800
and so anything you don't allow

105
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,240
is going to be blocked by default

106
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,073
on the inbound, based on
this particular router.
