1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,040
- Switches.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,520
Now hubs were originally
used to connect devices

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,540
on a network.

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,580
All of the devices will
be connected to a hub,

5
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,170
and anytime something went
into one port of the hub,

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,650
it would then repeat that
out all of the other ports.

7
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,660
This was known as a broadcast message.

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,760
Now this is because hubs were dumb.

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,800
They had no intelligence.

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,290
As networks got larger,

11
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,540
hubs caused a lot of collisions
and slowed down the network.

12
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,650
To solve this problem,

13
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,340
something came along called a bridge,

14
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,250
and this was used to separate
physical LANs or WANs

15
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,930
into two logical networks,

16
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,400
or connect two logical networks together.

17
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,750
Now switches are the
evolution of hubs and bridges.

18
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,640
Essentially every single port on a switch

19
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,030
acts as if it was a
bridged hub on each one.

20
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,960
This means that it
improves the data transfer

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,980
and security through the intelligent use

22
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,200
of MAC addresses.

23
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,550
Being able to figure out where a device is

24
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,160
and only sending the information out

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,670
that particular port of the
switch and ignoring the rest.

26
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,610
This reduces traffic
and increases security.

27
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,550
Now switches are subject to three main

28
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,810
types of attack though.

29
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,260
They are subject to MAC
flooding, MAC spoofing,

30
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,870
and physical tampering.

31
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,600
This is because they're trying to overcome

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,460
that logic and intelligence
that the switch has.

33
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,500
MAC flooding is an attempt to overwhelm

34
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,820
the limited switch memory that's set aside

35
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,960
to store the MAC addresses for each port,

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,340
and this is known as the
content addressable memory,

37
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,830
or CAM table.

38
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,630
Now if a switch is
flooded, it can fail-open

39
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,240
and begin to start acting like a hub

40
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,150
and broadcasting data
out every single port.

41
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,230
This is a problem that can start causing

42
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,540
confidentiality to be breached
inside your local network.

43
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,240
Now MAC spoofing, on the other hand,

44
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,070
occurs when an attacker
masks their own MAC address

45
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,070
to pretend that they are
having the MAC address

46
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,100
of some other machine on the network.

47
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,710
For example, wireless access
points may use MAC filtering

48
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,450
to prevent devices that are unknown

49
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,230
from joining the wireless network.

50
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,860
They do this my looking
at their MAC address

51
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,960
that's being reported,

52
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:54,705
and if it's not inside
their access control list,

53
00:01:54,705 --> 00:01:55,580
they'll block it from connecting.

54
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,150
Now if I switch my MAC address
to a known or allowed device,

55
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,980
I can gain access to that
network though by spoofing.

56
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,040
I pretend that I am an authorized device

57
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,590
using a known good MAC address,

58
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,423
and I pass right through that ACL.

59
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,780
MAC spoofing is also sometimes
combined with ARP spoofing.

60
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,880
ARP is an address resolution protocol,

61
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,750
and it relies on the MAC addresses

62
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,110
as a way of combining what
MAC address goes to which IP,

63
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,340
and which IP goes to which MAC address.

64
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,369
So they often combine a MAC
address spoof with an ARP spoof

65
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:27,770
as an attempt to be able
to have the attacker appear

66
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,420
that they are the
destination that somebody

67
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,790
is trying to send information to,

68
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,700
and use that as a way to
steal that information.

69
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,810
Now to prevent this,

70
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,170
you have to configure your switch

71
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,250
to accept limited numbers
of static MAC addresses,

72
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,350
limit the duration of
time that an ARP entry

73
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,540
is allowed on a host,

74
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,340
and conduct ARP inspections.

75
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,710
To keep track of what ARP is being used

76
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,430
with which MAC address and which IPs.

77
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,220
The third type of way
to overwhelm a switch

78
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,890
is to use physical tampering.

79
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,840
Physical tampering occurs when an attacker

80
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,140
attempts to gain physical
access to the switch,

81
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,930
because if you can touch a device,

82
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,700
you can pretty much configure
it to do whatever you want.

83
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,210
Each switch has a dedicated
management port on it,

84
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,750
and if an attacker can gain
access to the switch physically

85
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,010
by walking up to it,

86
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,390
they can connect their
laptop to the management port

87
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,990
and reconfigure that switch and
cause all sorts of problems.

88
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,410
Additionally, an attacker
could unplug cables,

89
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,600
or unplug the power itself from the switch

90
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,110
and this could cause a
denial of service attack.

91
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,990
Now to prevent physical tampering,

92
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,570
the switch should be locked up

93
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,880
in a network rack, or a network closet,

94
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,970
or behind closed doors so
that, that room is secure

95
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,123
using good physical security practices.
