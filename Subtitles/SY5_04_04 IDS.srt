1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,680
- What is an IDS?

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,440
Well, an IDS stands for the
Intrusion Detection System.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,700
This is a device or a piece of software

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,730
that's installed on a system or a network,

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,730
and it will analyze all of the
data that passes through it.

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,180
It does this so that it can try

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,990
to identify any incidents or attacks.

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,060
Intrusion Detection Systems
come in two different varieties,

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,180
the host-based Intrusion Detection System

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,820
and the network-based
Intrusion Detection System.

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,220
The first one we're going to talk about

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,610
is a host-based Intrusion
Detection System,

13
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,620
also called an H-I-D-S.

14
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,230
This usually takes the
form as a piece of software

15
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,490
that's installed on your computer

16
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,860
or on a server and it will protect it.

17
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,230
Now, the host-based
Intrusion Detection System

18
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,160
will sit there and log everything

19
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,940
that it thinks is suspicious.

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,180
We'll talk about what might be
suspicious in just a moment.

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,730
The second type is what's known

22
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,400
as a network-based
Intrusion Detection System,

23
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,220
or a NIDS, N-I-D-S.

24
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,390
This is a piece of hardware

25
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,810
that's installed on your network.

26
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,000
And all the traffic goes
through that switch,

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,970
and then it will get a
copy of that sent down

28
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,450
to the Network Intrusion Detection System.

29
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,630
If it's suspicious, it'll
log it and it'll alert on it.

30
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,120
Now, how do we know what
these systems will alert on?

31
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,020
Well, they're going to use one
of three different methods.

32
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,820
They're either going
to use signature-based,

33
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,140
policy-based, or anomaly-based detection.

34
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,060
Signature-based detection
is where the system

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,270
is looking for a specific string of bytes

36
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,800
that'll trigger the alert.

37
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,530
This works like any other
signature-based product.

38
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,800
This computer is going
to continually search

39
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,430
over and over for a known specific key.

40
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,010
And any time it sees that
combination of letters or bytes,

41
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,450
it knows that it's malicious.

42
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,320
It'll flag it and it will alert on it.

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,440
The next type is what's known
as policy-based detection.

44
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,460
This is going to rely on a

45
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,580
specific declaration
of the security policy.

46
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,130
For example, if your company has a policy

47
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,210
that no one is allowed to use Telnet,

48
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,210
any time this system sees somebody trying

49
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,350
to connect on port 23, which
is the port for Telnet,

50
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,530
it's going to flag it,
log it, and alert on it.

51
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,010
The third type is statistical
anomaly-based detection.

52
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,780
Often, this is referred to as just

53
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,890
anomaly-based detection or
statistical-based detection.

54
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,680
This is going to analyze all
of the current traffic patterns

55
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,690
against an established baseline,

56
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,040
and anytime it sees something that goes

57
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,290
outside the statistical norm,
it's going to alert on it.

58
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,550
So if I've been watching
your network for a while

59
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,250
and I know what normal looks like,

60
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,360
and everybody always works
from nine in the morning

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,980
until five in the afternoon,

62
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,390
and now I start seeing somebody

63
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,170
downloading large amounts of data

64
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,920
around two o'clock in the morning,

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,910
that's outside our normal baseline

66
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,280
and we would flag that and alert on that.

67
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,780
Now, speaking of alerts,

68
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,220
let's talk about what these alerts mean.

69
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,520
There are four different types of alerts.

70
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,040
They're either true
positive, true negative,

71
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,530
false positive, or false negative.

72
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,600
Now, a true positive means
something bad happened

73
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,840
and the system flagged
it and alerted on it.

74
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,920
That's good because it means
our system is tuned properly.

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,820
A true negative means something
good or normal happened

76
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,520
and the system didn't flag it.

77
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,380
Again, that's good,

78
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,610
because our system's
working like it should.

79
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,360
But when we get into something
like false positives,

80
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,120
this is where some legitimate activity

81
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,120
is being as identified as an attack.

82
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,040
For example, if you log on the computer

83
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,040
and you start up Microsoft
Word, that's authorized.

84
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,740
But if the system thought
that was malicious

85
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,480
and flagged it and alerted on it,

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,980
that's considered a false positive.

87
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,640
Now, next we have what's
called a false negative.

88
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,330
This is when something bad happens

89
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,840
but it's identified as
legitimate activity.

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,100
In other words, it isn't flagged
and it wasn't alerted on.

91
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,640
Let's say you downloaded a virus,

92
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,360
and you ran the virus and
something bad happened,

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,400
but your Intrusion Detection
System didn't see it,

94
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,650
didn't flag on it, and didn't alert on it.

95
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,830
This is a false negative.

96
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,360
So now that we have a better understanding

97
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,360
of true positive, true negative,

98
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,360
false positive, and false negative,

99
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,030
let's talk about what an
IDS can and can't do for us.

100
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,690
It's really important to realize that IDSs

101
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,860
are only going to alert and
log on suspicious activity,

102
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,540
they won't be able to stop it.

103
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,470
If you want the activity to be stopped,

104
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,680
then you need to invest in an IPS,

105
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,040
or an Intrusion Prevention System.

106
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,130
They work very similarly to an IDS

107
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,240
except they have the ability

108
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,240
to stop malicious activity
from being executed.

109
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,470
Now, IDSs and IPSs can create

110
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,560
a lot of valuable information for us,

111
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,040
and it all gets logged.

112
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,930
If you're using a host IDS though,

113
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,410
it's going to be logged to
your individual computer.

114
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,920
You want to ensure that
you set up a syslog server

115
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,010
and have those log files
routinely taken from the host

116
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,240
and send it to a centralized server.

117
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,150
Now, why would I want to do that?

118
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,880
Well, if someone's going
to compromise your machine,

119
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,600
we want to be able go back
and recreate through the logs

120
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,390
what happened to cause the attack

121
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,420
so we can stop it next time.

122
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,500
IF all the logs were kept on your machine

123
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,380
and the attacker got
access to your machine,

124
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,660
they could have damaged
or altered the logs.

125
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,480
But if we've been pushing
them off to a syslog server,

126
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,230
it means those logs are protected

127
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,560
from being modified by the attacker.

128
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,100
This is why we want to ensure we have

129
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,130
a good, pristine copy of our logs

130
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,540
so we can always go back
and protect our network

131
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,740
based on what we've
seen that was malicious.
