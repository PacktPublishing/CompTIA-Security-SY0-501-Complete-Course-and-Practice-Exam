00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,710
- In the last lesson we mentioned
cold sites and warm sites,

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,310
and for these to work you have to be able

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,010
to bring your data and get 'em over

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,050
to those new networks
that you install there.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,730
Well, to do that you have to have

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,680
a good backup to begin with.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,540
Data backups can be
conducted using full backups,

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,150
incremental backups, or
differential backups.

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,890
Now, when I discuss each of these types

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,740
I'm going to use the
word drive to describe

11
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,760
the way data is being backed up.

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,400
This can be the entire hard disk,

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,170
but it can also be just a
file or a folder on that disk

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,730
depending on how you scope
your backup configurations.

15
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,650
But for the purposes of my explanations

16
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,960
and these definitions, I'm
just going to say drive

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,370
throughout the rest of the
lesson to keep it easy.

18
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,310
Now, the first kind we have
is known as a full backup.

19
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,660
When you do a full backup,
all of the contents

20
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,960
of your drive are backed up,
that's every single file.

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,720
Now, when we go to an incremental backup,

22
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,780
which is our second type,
this is going to backup

23
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,260
only the contents of the drive

24
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,570
that have changed since
the last full backup,

25
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,020
or since your last incremental backup.

26
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,060
Now, the third category we have is known

27
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,670
as a differential backup.

28
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,100
Differential backups will
only backup the contents

29
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,260
of the drive that have changed
since the last full backup.

30
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,700
So, let's say that every
Sunday at 9:00 p.m.

31
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,270
I run a full weekly backup of the drive,

32
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,880
then the rest of the week
I use a differential backup

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,660
to create backups of any files or folders

34
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,050
that have changed since Sunday
when I did that full backup.

35
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,510
This is good because if I have a drive

36
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,130
fail on Wednesday, I can
restore from the full backup

37
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,420
we made on Sunday and then
the differential backup

38
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,000
that I made on Tuesday,
and all the file changes

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,610
that happened on Monday and Tuesday

40
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,970
would also be included in that
Tuesday differential backup.

41
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,110
Now, there is one problem
with full backups,

42
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,900
they take a lot of time.

43
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,170
Differential backups take up less time,

44
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,560
but they can still take a while

45
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,100
if you have a lot of changes,

46
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,160
and so many organizations instead,

47
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,820
use what's known as an incremental backup.

48
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,610
Now, this only creates a backup
of everything that's changed

49
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,240
since the last full backup,

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,630
or since the last incremental backup.

51
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,140
So let's go back to our example

52
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,130
and configure our backups for our server.

53
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,840
Let's say we decide to do a full backup

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,740
every Sunday just like before,

55
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,850
but instead of using a differential backup

56
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,320
we're going to use an
incremental backup each night.

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,900
This is going to save us some time.

58
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,710
So, Monday we do an incremental,

59
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,980
Tuesday we do an incremental,

60
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,260
Wednesday I do an incremental,

61
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,640
Thursday I do an incremental,
and Friday my drive fails.

62
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,760
Which backups do I need to
use to restore all my data?

63
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,280
Well, instead of needing
Sunday, the full backup,

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,270
and Thursday night, if we'd
done a differential backup,

65
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,990
we're now going to have to go and get

66
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,090
every single one from
Sunday, the full backup,

67
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,600
and then Monday's incremental,

68
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,870
Tuesday's incremental,
Wednesday's incremental,

69
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,430
and finally, Thursday's incremental,

70
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,530
and we'll have to restore
them in that order.

71
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,260
Now you can see the tough choice we have

72
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,980
between using incrementals
and differentials,

73
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,750
because incrementals take
a lot less time to backup,

74
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,460
but the differentials
make it a lot quicker

75
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,700
when we need to restore,

76
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,750
and so this going to be a
choice you have to make.

77
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,540
Do you want quick backups
and lengthy restores,

78
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,502
or do you want long
backups and quick restores?

79
00:02:54,502 --> 00:02:56,969
(electronic beats)
