1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,820
- During an incident response,

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,360
we often need to collect
evidence of that cyber attack

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,940
for further analysis.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,130
For example, if your main
server's been infected

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,350
with some kind of malware
as part of an attack,

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,760
you'd want to get that cleared up

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,470
and get that server back
online as quickly as possible

8
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,820
to minimize the disruption
to your operations.

9
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,880
But, if you do that, you may erase

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,240
the evidence of the attack,

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,980
and that would make it impossible
to figure out who did it.

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,390
Now to overcome this challenge,

13
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,810
we often use digital forensic
collection techniques

14
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,590
to make forensic images of
the data on those servers

15
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,970
and we use that as evidence
for later analysis.

16
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,210
By doing that, it allows
your incident response team

17
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,060
to help get your server back online

18
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,400
as quickly as possible
and resume operations,

19
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,740
but also maintain that evidence.

20
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,170
Now, your incident response
team may need that evidence

21
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,030
because they may be working
with law enforcement.

22
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,480
And if you're doing that, you're probably

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,100
trying to seek criminal prosecution

24
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,410
for the attacker who
broke into your systems.

25
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,920
Now as part of your data collection

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,350
and evidence collection efforts,

27
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,060
you're going to do a
lot of different things.

28
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,830
For example, you're
going to capture and hash

29
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,010
the system images.

30
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,470
This means you're going to
use a tool like FTK Imager

31
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,200
to make an exact copy of
that server's hard drive

32
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,290
and then hash it to make
sure it doesn't change

33
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,890
while you're analyzing it.

34
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,100
Then, you're going to analyze
the data you collected

35
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,430
using software tools.

36
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,530
You're going to use forensic tools,

37
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,705
things like FTK, the
Forensic Toolkit, or EnCase.

38
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:17,120
Then, you're going to have
to capture screenshots

39
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,953
of the machine.

40
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,380
What was the machine looking like

41
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,880
when you arrived on the scene?

42
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,310
You want to capture pictures of that

43
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,010
so you know exactly what it looked like.

44
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,140
You might go back and look at

45
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,940
your network traffic logs and captures

46
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,010
and go and review all that

47
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,860
and see how they moved
throughout the network

48
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,790
as you're trying to trace back the attack.

49
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,960
If you think somebody was
physically on your property,

50
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,110
you may want to capture video

51
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,130
from the closed circuit TV system.

52
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,000
As you're collecting all
this data and evidence,

53
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,200
you want to consider
the order of volatility,

54
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,130
which means which order does things

55
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,120
get modified by quickest?

56
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,560
The quickest thing that gets modified

57
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,700
is the cache inside the processor.

58
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,030
Then the memory, then the swap files,

59
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,280
then the hard drives, right?

60
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,020
And you think about which one
is going to get changed first.

61
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,620
When you do that you
have to collect things

62
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,260
based on that order as well.

63
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,700
And anything on the victim machine

64
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,570
can be modified if there's a
bad guy on that machine, right?

65
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,170
And so we want to collect the
evidence as quickly as possible.

66
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,390
Then, we want to take statements

67
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,840
from witnesses and administrators.

68
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,740
What did they see?

69
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,580
What made them think
there was an incident?

70
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,610
Maybe there was somebody who said,

71
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,960
hey, my computer all of a sudden,

72
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,910
the mouse started jumping
all over the screen.

73
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,830
That's something you need to
collect the information from

74
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,367
and figure out why it did that.

75
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:21,020
Then, we want to review our
licensing and documentation,

76
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,040
and figure out do we
have the proper license

77
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,290
for all of our systems?

78
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,680
And do we understand how they work,

79
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,520
and are they working the
way they were designed

80
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,020
based on the documentation?

81
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,260
And then of course we're
going to track our man hours

82
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,482
and our expenses, because at the end

83
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:33,970
of this incident response,

84
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,680
someone's going to say
how much did it cost us.

85
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,010
And if you look at most
data breeches in the U.S.,

86
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,350
large companies are suffering millions

87
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,200
and millions of dollars of losses

88
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
in the cost of these data breeches,

89
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,840
both in the response efforts to it

90
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,410
as well as the value of
the data that's lost.

91
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,290
Now, in the next lesson,
I'm going to show you

92
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,350
how a forensic disc
image is actually created

93
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,880
during an incident response.

94
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,330
For the security plus exam,
no one is going to ask you

95
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,830
to conduct this operation.

96
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,360
But, it's going to give you
a taste of digital forensics

97
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,530
and see if the idea of being a

98
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,880
digital forensics examiner interests you.

99
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,870
If it does, you may want
to download and play

100
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,130
with some forensic tools
like Forensic Toolkit,

101
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,017
I'm going to use in the
next lesson, or EnCase.

102
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:14,319
(upbeat music)
