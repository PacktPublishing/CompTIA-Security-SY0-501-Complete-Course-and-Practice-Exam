1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,160
- Mobile devices are an
increasingly large part of our life.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,910
They are doing everything
with us these days.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,160
When we're on travel, we have 'em with us.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,380
And sometimes if we're not
careful, someone can steal 'em.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,840
For example, this guy's
about to get his iPad

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,410
stolen out of his backpack.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,430
It's not going to be a
very good day for him.

8
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,830
Now, we have to think
about all of the data

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,370
that's on that device.

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,360
Let's say you were on a
family trip and you just took

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,060
a whole bunch of pictures
from your vacation.

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,120
And now you're returning
to the United States,

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,110
you're going through the airport,

14
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,080
and somebody steals your phone.

15
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,600
You're not just losing
the value of your phone,

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,970
but you're losing the value
of all of those memories

17
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,810
that may be irreplaceable.

18
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,610
So when you think about
what's on your device,

19
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,130
one of the most important things

20
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,700
is to always ensure that you
have a good device backup.

21
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,350
And the reason is, the
memories, the photos,

22
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,810
your files, that's irreplaceable.

23
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,850
The device itself, you may
have cell phone insurance for

24
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,350
or you'll just go buy a new one.

25
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,090
But the information on it
is what's really critical.

26
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,190
Now, let's take it to a darker side.

27
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,050
What else is on your device?

28
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,560
Well, if you're like most people,

29
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,630
you also do mobile banking on your device.

30
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,320
And so if you don't have your
device encrypted and locked

31
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,760
and protected, somebody
can take that device

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,320
and access your account.

33
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,850
That's another big issue.

34
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,830
So what do we do about this?

35
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, the first thing is we
want to encrypt our device.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,100
We want to use full disk
encryption on our cell phones

37
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,350
and our tablets.

38
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,320
By doing this, even if someone
is able to steal the device,

39
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,960
they won't be able to
access the information

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,950
on the device without the
proper PIN and encryption key.

41
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,140
Additionally, we want to make sure

42
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,300
that we're thinking about setting
up tracking on our device.

43
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,160
If the device is lost or stolen,

44
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,410
you should be able to be
pulling the information

45
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,510
from that phone and
where its GPS location is

46
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,130
to determine where it is.

47
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,210
Now, just because you know where it is,

48
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,370
doesn't mean you should
go get it yourself.

49
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,510
In fact, police recommend that you don't

50
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,290
try to recover your device
alone if it's stolen.

51
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,080
Instead, you should go to the police

52
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,060
and have them go with you to
the location of your device

53
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,010
that you've been able to find

54
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,940
based on its location tracking.

55
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,940
And how exactly can you find
out where your phone is?

56
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,770
Well, if you're using an Apple device,

57
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,530
you can use Find my iPhone.

58
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,310
If you're using Android,
you can use Find my Phone.

59
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,630
These are websites that
connect to your phone

60
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,560
based on its data location
and its GPS signal

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,440
and it will tell you where
that phone is located.

62
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,400
Now, these sites also have
some additional features.

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,720
One of them is the remote lock option.

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,190
This will allow you to
remotely lock you phone

65
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,380
from the website.

66
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,200
This will make it so it
requires a PIN or a password

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,130
before the person who has your device

68
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,430
can actually log in to it
and get access to your data.

69
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,660
Another great feature of
these sites is the ability

70
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,670
to conduct a remote wipe.

71
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,970
A remote wipe is going to allow you

72
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,470
to remotely erase the
contents of the device

73
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,500
to ensure that no information is recovered

74
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,820
by the thief.

75
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,550
Now, why would you want to
remotely wipe your device?

76
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,410
Because maybe you have some
personal things on that,

77
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,350
maybe you have personal text messages

78
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,770
or photographs or banking information

79
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,570
that you don't want anybody seeing.

80
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,020
By using remote wipe, even if the criminal

81
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,980
has your device, they're
not going to be able

82
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,740
to see anything on it
because you've already

83
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,443
formatted the device, even
from a remote location.
