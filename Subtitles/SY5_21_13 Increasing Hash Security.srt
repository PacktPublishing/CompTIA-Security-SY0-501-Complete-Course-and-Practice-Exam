00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,170
- How can we increase the
strength of our hashes,

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,240
especially when using them as
part of our password security?

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,540
First, we can use key stretching.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,760
Key stretching is a technique

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,870
that's used to mitigate a weaker key

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,490
by increasing its effectiveness

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,330
and thereby increasing the
time needed to crack it.

8
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,790
When you stretch a weaker key,

9
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,560
the weaker key is run through an algorithm

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,740
to create a longer, more secure key

11
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,870
than is normally used.

12
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,900
And it has to be at least 128 bits long.

13
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,950
Many systems are going
to utilize key stretching

14
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,750
to increase the security they provide.

15
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,010
Systems like Wi-Fi Protected Access,

16
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,460
Wi-Fi Protected Access version
2, Pretty Good Privacy,

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,940
BeCrypt, and others
all use key stretching.

18
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,730
Another technique we can
use is known as salting.

19
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,880
Salting is a technique
of adding random data

20
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,040
into a one-way cryptographic hash

21
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,480
to help protect against
password cracking techniques

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,720
like dictionary attacks,
brute force attacks,

23
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,040
and rainbow tables.

24
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,730
Using a nonce is another method

25
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,640
to help secure a weaker password,

26
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,890
where a number used
once, known as a nonce,

27
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,180
is added to the
password-based authentication

28
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,330
to help prevent an attacker

29
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,640
from reusing your password

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,730
if they're able to steal it somehow.

31
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,563
Another good tip

32
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:07,480
to help prevent password
cracking attacks is

33
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,130
to limit the number of login attempts

34
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,330
that are allowed prior
to locking out the user.

35
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,860
Normally, you want this to
be set at three attempts,

36
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,210
so if they enter the password
incorrectly three times,

37
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,760
the account is going to be locked.

38
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,080
Yes, this can be a pain for the user.

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,920
But it does increase the security

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,900
and drastically slows down an attacker

41
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,430
who's trying to guess the user's password

42
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,514
and break into the system.

00:01:27,514 --> 00:01:29,498
