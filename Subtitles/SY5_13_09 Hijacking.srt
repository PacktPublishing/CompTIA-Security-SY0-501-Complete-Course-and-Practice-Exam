1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,270
- Hijacking, next we have hijacking

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,840
which is the exploitation
of a computer session

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,570
in an attempt to gain
unauthorized access to data,

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,050
services, or other resources
on a computer or server.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,100
There are eight types of session hijacking

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,440
that can be performed.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,500
Session theft, TCP/IP
hijacking, blind hijacking,

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,470
clickjacking, Man-in-the-Middle,

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,800
Man-in-the-Browser, the
watering hole attack

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,720
and cross-site-scripting attacks.

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,790
The first type of hijacking
is known as session theft.

12
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,850
With session theft the
attacker is going to guess

13
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,550
the session ID for a web session

14
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,980
and that enables them to takeover

15
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,480
the already authorized
and established session

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,840
of that client.

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,750
Each session is uniquely
identified with a random string

18
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,360
but if the attacker can
determine or guess that string

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,950
they can take over the
authenticated session

20
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,830
with the server.

21
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,960
And this example, you
can see this is occurring

22
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,970
at the session layer of the OSI model

23
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,340
but it can also occur at the
network or transport layer too.

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,700
Now when it does it's
called TCP/IP hijacking.

25
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,640
Because it occurs when an
attacker takes over a TCP session

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,090
between two computers
without the need of a cookie

27
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,780
or other host access.

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,990
Because TCP sessions only authenticate

29
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,860
during the initial three-way handshake

30
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,350
the attacker can jump into the session

31
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,420
at any time they want if they can guess

32
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,700
the next number in the packet sequence.

33
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,460
This can also be used to create
a denial of service attack

34
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,400
against the initial host that
way they can take it over

35
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,290
and not let that person
jump back into the session.

36
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,420
Now, the next type of hijacking
is called blind hijacking

37
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,680
because it occurs when the attacker

38
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,480
blindly injects data into
a communication stream

39
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,050
and won't be able to see the results

40
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,630
whether they're successful or not.

41
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,490
Clickjacking is our next type.

42
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,950
This attack uses multiple
transparent layers

43
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,050
to trick a user into clicking
on a button or link on a page

44
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,340
when they were intending
to click on something else.

45
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,690
Basically the hyperlink
to the malicious content

46
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,250
is hidden under some
legitimate clickable content.

47
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,930
So you think you're clicking on an image

48
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,180
and you're actually clicking on some link

49
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,740
that takes you elsewhere.

50
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,210
Now a Man-in-the-Middle attack

51
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,760
is probably the attack
you've heard most before.

52
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,880
This is also one that is commonly
used in session hijacking.

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,610
A Man-in-the-Middle attack causes data

54
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,520
to flow through the attacker's computer

55
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,900
where it can then be intercepted

56
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,240
or manipulated as it passes through.

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,870
This is considered an
active type of interception.

58
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,870
So let's pretend that you've
got some kind of malware

59
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,930
on your computer and
now all of your traffic

60
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,100
is going to route through
this attacker's machine.

61
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,840
Well, if you wanted to transfer $50

62
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,550
from your bank account to your friend's

63
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,960
but the attacker changes the amount

64
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,320
and the destination of the account

65
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,960
you may now be sending
$5000 to the attacker

66
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,890
instead of the $50 to your friend.

67
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,730
This is the idea of a Man-in-the-Middle.

68
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,740
Since the attacker is sitting

69
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,330
right in the middle of that connection

70
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,070
they can see and manipulate any data

71
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,130
as it's being sent back and forth.

72
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,230
Now a Man-in-the-Browser is very similar

73
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,320
to the Man-in-the-Middle

74
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,320
except it's limited to your
browser's web communication

75
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,050
instead of looking at
the entire communication.

76
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,500
This can occur because you have a Trojan

77
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,360
that's infected your
vulnerable web browser

78
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,840
and it modifies web pages or transactions

79
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,870
that are being done within that browser.

80
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,190
To prevent this you should insure

81
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,490
you have a good anti-malware
solution installed

82
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,880
and you have the latest security updates

83
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,820
for your web browser

84
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,220
because this will pretty much eliminate

85
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,200
the Man-in-the-Browser attack.

86
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,830
Next you have a watering hole.

87
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,470
And a watering hole is
something that we described

88
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,650
all the way back in the
beginning of this course.

89
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,580
It occurs when malware
is laced on a website

90
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,690
that the attacker knows
his potential victims

91
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,920
are going to access.

92
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,410
Now this can also be modified

93
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,260
to allow for session hijacking too

94
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,350
because the attacker can
takeover that website

95
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,370
and grab the information

96
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,640
between your client and the server itself.

97
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,460
Finally we have cross-site-scripting

98
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,200
which we've also discussed before.

99
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,620
Now I'm mentioning it here briefly

100
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,980
because cross-site-scripting
is another way

101
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,550
that you can use this vulnerability

102
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,360
to conduct session
hijacking against a victim.

103
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,860
It does this by targeting
that client's computer

104
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,730
and tricking it into
thinking the code came

105
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,090
from a trusted web server.

106
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,970
And if you can trick it successfully

107
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,930
then the client is going
to execute that code

108
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,120
and this can give that
attacker a hijack place

109
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,853
inside that communication stream.
