1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,440
- RADIUS and TACACS+.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,200
RADIUS is the Remote Authentication
Dial-In User Service.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,030
It provides centralized administration

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,190
of dial-up, VPN, and
wireless authentication

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,100
so that you can use that with both 802.1x

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,800
and the Extensible
Authentication Protocol, or EAP.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,320
RADIUS is a client/server
protocol that runs

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,400
over the seventh layer of the OSI model,

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,930
the application layer.

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,620
RADIUS is usually configured to be run

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,210
on a separate server,
but it can also be loaded

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,330
up on a Windows server in
smaller domain environments.

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,400
RADIUS is used to authenticate users,

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,820
authorize them to services,

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,440
and account for their
usage of those services.

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,880
This is the typical
AAA that we spoke about

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,330
all the way back in
section one of the course,

18
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,640
Authentication,
Authorization, and Accounting.

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,760
RADIUS also utilizes UDP
for making its connections,

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,990
making it fairly fast
during its authentication

21
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,080
to authorization functions.

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,290
RADIUS commonly uses port 1812

23
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,790
for its authentication messages,

24
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,930
and port 1813 for its accounting messages.

25
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,660
Some proprietary versions of RADIUS

26
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,140
may also use ports 1645 and 1646 instead.

27
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,960
Now, exam tip here, I
would have these ports

28
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,900
memorized as part of the things you need

29
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,760
to know before test day because you may

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,670
see some test questions on 'em.

31
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,430
Now, while RADIUS is a
cross-platform standard,

32
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,710
there is a proprietary protocol from Cisco

33
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,150
called TACACS+ that
we've mentioned before.

34
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,270
This is the Terminal
Access Controller Access

35
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,640
Control System Plus which
can perform the role

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,880
of an authenticator in an 802.1x network.

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,750
Now, it's up to you to determine which one

38
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,040
is best for your organization's needs.

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,370
Personally, I've used
RADIUS almost exclusively

40
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,960
within my organizations.

41
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,280
I've found that TACACS+
is a little bit slower

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,510
to operate because it's relying on TCP

43
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,890
instead of UDP, and operates over port 49.

44
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,370
But TACACS+ does have some benefits.

45
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,850
It gives you some additional security

46
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,300
and independently conducts
its authentication,

47
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,920
authorization, and accounting processes.

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,320
TACACS+ supports all network protocols.

49
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,670
But RADIUS, on the other hand,

50
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,850
doesn't support the
remote access protocol,

51
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,590
NetBIOS Frame protocol,
X.25 PAD connections,

52
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,610
and some others.

53
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,260
Overall, TACACS+ is an excellent choice,

54
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,840
but only if you're going to be using Cisco

55
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,380
devices across your network.

56
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,040
Because if you want to have
that cross-platform capability,

57
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,550
then you're going to
have to go with RADIUS,

58
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,507
the way that I've chosen in the past.

59
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:20,719
(electronic droning)
