1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,223
- Authentication.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,460
As the security of our networks

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,760
becomes more important
to our organizations,

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,830
we have to continue to seek better ways

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,640
to increase that security.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,630
Now although many organizations have been

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,200
increasingly adding
difficult password schemes

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,910
to create a more secure network

9
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,500
such as using things like upper case

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,740
and lower case letters,

11
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,573
numbers,

12
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:21,406
symbols

13
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:23,435
and passwords over 14
characters in length,

14
00:00:23,435 --> 00:00:24,920
studies have shown

15
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,110
that the use of
multi-factor authentication,

16
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,780
is exponentially more secure.

17
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,670
Now what exactly is
multi-factor authentication?

18
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,840
Well, it's the use of two or more means

19
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,870
to prove a user's identity.

20
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,340
There are five basic
factors of authentication

21
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,000
that you can consider when determining

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,260
if is who they say they are.

23
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,510
They are knowledge,

24
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,370
ownership,

25
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,370
characteristic,

26
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,203
location

27
00:00:47,203 --> 00:00:48,500
and action.

28
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,190
Now the knowledge factor is concerned

29
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,190
with the user providing a
piece of memorized information.

30
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,510
This can be a password,

31
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,350
a pin,

32
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,850
a combination to a lock,

33
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,140
their mother's maiden name,

34
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,510
their social security number,

35
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,420
their birthday,

36
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,560
their place of birth

37
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,400
or any other piece of information

38
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,570
that can be memorized

39
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,880
and recited when they're asked for it.

40
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,140
The second factor is what we
call the ownership factor.

41
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,410
Now an ownership factor
is concerned with a user

42
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,720
proving that they have
something in their possession

43
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,570
that uniquely identifies them.

44
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,460
In the real world,

45
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,390
this might be something like

46
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,140
pulling out your driver's
license or your passport.

47
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,600
Now in the electronic world though,

48
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,780
we use other things.

49
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,250
Things like token devices

50
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,638
that are small handheld device

51
00:01:26,638 --> 00:01:28,530
that has a randomly generated code

52
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,760
that changes every 30 to 60 seconds

53
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,860
that the server and the client both know.

54
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,400
It could be something like a smart card

55
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,940
that you insert into a card reader

56
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,150
on your desktop that gives you access.

57
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,320
It could be a USB dongle

58
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,350
where you plug it in

59
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,920
and that gives you access.

60
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,980
Or it can be an authentication mechanism

61
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,320
that sends you a unique and random number

62
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,640
each time you try to log in

63
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,920
and they text that to you

64
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,480
and you then enter back in

65
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,110
showing that you have physical possession

66
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,030
of your cellphone

67
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,760
that accesses your token.

68
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,340
The third thing we have is what's called

69
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,870
the characteristic factor.

70
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,560
Now a characteristic is defined

71
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,750
as something that the person is.

72
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,900
This is usually accomplished

73
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,390
using some form of bio-metric technology.

74
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,860
Like a fingerprint scanner,

75
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,000
an iris reader

76
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,490
or a facial recognition unlock feature.

77
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,410
For example,

78
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,250
on the old iPhone 5S,

79
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,590
they had a fingerprint reader

80
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,110
embedded into the home button

81
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,420
and you put your thumb on there

82
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,000
and that would unlock the phone.

83
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,180
Now on the newer iPhones,

84
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,280
the iPhone X's,

85
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,620
they utilize a dual front facing camera

86
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,180
that's going to scan your face

87
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,890
and figure out if it is you

88
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,030
based on the distance
between different features,

89
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,930
like your nose to your ear.

90
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,020
Another form of this,

91
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,130
is called a vocal pattern recognition

92
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,250
where someone is going to speak

93
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,440
and it's going to pick out
the pattern of your voice,

94
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,010
to uniquely identify you.

95
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,840
This is something that
banks are beginning using

96
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,090
to uniquely identify their
customers over the phone

97
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,003
before helping them with
the customer service.

98
00:02:45,003 --> 00:02:46,820
Now the fourth factor we have,

99
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,013
is called location.

100
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:50,530
This factor refers to where a person is

101
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,500
when they're trying to
log into their account.

102
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,333
For example,

103
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,340
I tend to travel a lot for work.

104
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,060
When I attempt to log
into my Gmail account

105
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,030
when I'm traveling,

106
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,380
their system can sometimes
flag that as unusual,

107
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,830
and they'll ask me for a second piece

108
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,390
of information to verify,

109
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,050
I am who I say I am.

110
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,830
You're organization may require a user

111
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,270
to be within a certain city,

112
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,640
a state or country before they can log in

113
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,700
based on the GPS of your
device or the IP address

114
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,680
from where you're attempting access.

115
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,120
Our fifth and final factor,

116
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,340
is called action.

117
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,000
An action refers to
something that a user does.

118
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,010
This isn't a commonly used
factor in many networks though.

119
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,740
The action factor can be something

120
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,560
that talks about how
you perform something.

121
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,393
For example,

122
00:03:28,393 --> 00:03:29,330
the way you draw a picture,

123
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,610
or the way you sign your name,

124
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,890
could be used as an action factor.

125
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,020
So now that we covered the five factors,

126
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,200
I want to drive home a really

127
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,970
important concept for the exam.

128
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,770
If you're only using one of these factors

129
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,690
at a time to identify your user,

130
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,360
this is called single-factor
authentication.

131
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,980
Now sometimes you can have two

132
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,740
or more things being asked for,

133
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,700
but they're all the same
type of one of these five.

134
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,533
For example,

135
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:52,670
if I say you logged in

136
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,660
using your username and your password,

137
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,690
this is two things.

138
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,800
Is this multi-factor or
single-factor authentication?

139
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,900
Well, because a username and a password

140
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,190
are both something you know,

141
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,510
or a knowledge factor,

142
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,580
this is still considered

143
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,380
single-factor authentication.

144
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,280
This is an important concept
to understand for the exam.

145
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,500
Now to increase security,

146
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,150
we want to use at least two
factors of authentication

147
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,320
creating dual-factor or
multi-factor authentication.

148
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,170
For example,

149
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,800
if you had a smart card
token and a pin number,

150
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,130
that's something you have,

151
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:21,963
possession,

152
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:23,270
and something you know,

153
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,170
knowledge.

154
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,010
You put these together,

155
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,250
that gives you two factors

156
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,220
which is multi-factor authentication.

157
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,544
Now this is going to be a lot more secure,

158
00:04:29,544 --> 00:04:31,310
because you have two different things

159
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,540
that the person has to have

160
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,250
to be able to get into your system.

161
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,320
Security is constantly evolving,

162
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,130
and so we're always adding additional

163
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,150
mechanisms of authentication.

164
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,940
The most securities is what we call,

165
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,160
the one-time used password.

166
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,990
These are implemented
generally using either

167
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,800
a time-based or a hash-based mechanism.

168
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,490
Now with a Time-based
One Time used Password,

169
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,300
or a TOTP,

170
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,590
a password is computed from

171
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,890
a shared secret and a current time.

172
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,943
This is often used with RSA key fobs,

173
00:04:58,943 --> 00:05:01,520
where they create a
seemingly random number

174
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,990
that's displayed on this ownership factor,

175
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,400
and then you're going to type that in

176
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,360
and the server and the
client both would know it,

177
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,830
but nobody else will.

178
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,410
And since these passwords are constantly

179
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,410
changing every 30 or 60 seconds,

180
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,020
they can only be used one time,

181
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,060
before they start changing again.

182
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,470
Now this time-based approach
is actually a variation

183
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,980
of the hash-based approach

184
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,150
known as the HMAC-based One Time

185
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,654
Password algorithm or HOTP.

186
00:05:24,654 --> 00:05:27,230
This algorithm actually
computes a password

187
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,540
from a shared secret

188
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,373
and it's synchronized

189
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:31,660
across both the client and the server.

190
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,220
Each time that password
is entered in to log in,

191
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,560
a new password is created

192
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,320
using this hash-based algorithm

193
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,010
and it's synchronized between the client

194
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,570
and the server making sure
that it's only used one time.

195
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,410
As you can see,

196
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,310
there are a lot of ways
to conduct authentication.

197
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,590
In this section of the course,

198
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,410
we're going to focus
exclusively on authentication,

199
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,490
the different technologies

200
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,640
and the different
mechanisms that are used.
