00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,310
- In this demonstration,
you're going to learn how

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,800
to create a VPN connection
from a Windows machine

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,060
in order to secure its
connection over a wired

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,850
or wireless network all the way back

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,290
to the corporate network.

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,690
Let's jump into the lab environment

7
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,150
and get started setting up our VPN.

8
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,070
In this demonstration,
I'm going to show you how

9
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,940
to create a VPN connection
on a Windows machine.

10
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,460
For this example, I'm going
to use a Windows 7 machine,

11
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,140
but it's pretty much the same process

12
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,910
in any version of Windows.

13
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,010
What we're going to do
is I'm going to click

14
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,350
on this wireless network
that's currently connected,

15
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,340
and I'm going to go to Open
Network and Sharing Center.

16
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,370
Now, from here, we're going to go

17
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,560
to Set up a new connection or network,

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,170
and this will bring up our dialog box

19
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,570
to create our VPN.

20
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,350
We want to use Connect to a workplace,

21
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,100
which is going to set up our
dial-up or VPN connection.

22
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,300
We'll hit Next, and then from here,

23
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,020
we're going to either
use it over the internet

24
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,510
or a direct dial.

25
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,200
In our case, we're going to
create a secure VPN tunnel

26
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,530
over the internet.

27
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,940
And then we'll give it our IP address,

28
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,800
in my case, it's 198.10.20.12.

29
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,893
And I'll give it a name, let's
call it the Corporate VPN.

30
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,310
And then from there,
we're going to hit Next.

31
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,840
We have to put in our
username and our password,

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,300
so let's say it was jason.dion

33
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,500
and my password of password

34
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,393
and then we can hit Connect.

35
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,293
And there you go,

36
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:20,430
you're now connected to the VPN

37
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,850
and you can see that we have an access

38
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,450
over a VPN connection,

39
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,510
and we have our wireless
connectivity on top of that.

40
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,700
And that's going to
make that secure tunnel

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,610
so that nobody can see anything
that we're transmitting

42
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,953
from our laptop over the internet
back into our VPN network.
