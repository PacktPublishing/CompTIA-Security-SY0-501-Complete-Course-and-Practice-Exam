1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,570
- Biometric readers.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,750
Biometrics rely on
physical characteristics,

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,180
to identify a person properly.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,477
This is most commonly done
by using your fingerprints,

5
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:11,516
by scanning the retina inside your eye,

6
00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:13,090
or by measuring the distance,

7
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,270
between different parts of your face.

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,700
Now if you remember all the way back,

9
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,970
to section one of this course,

10
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,520
we talked about the five
factors of authentication.

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,748
This was something you
know, something you have,

12
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:25,000
something you are, something you do,

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,430
and somewhere you are.

14
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,900
Now when we talk about biometrics,

15
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,519
we're focused on that third
factor: something you are.

16
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:32,690
Because this is some part of you.

17
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,740
It's your eye, it's your
fingerprint, it's your voice,

18
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,990
it's something that is innately,

19
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,487
part of your ability
and part of your person.

20
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:41,260
Now when we talk about fingerprints,

21
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,110
fingerprints have become,

22
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,240
a very common identification system.

23
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,520
At this point it's even
gone beyond door locks,

24
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,450
and it's now integrated
into our smart phones,

25
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,756
and our lap tops for log in.

26
00:00:49,756 --> 00:00:53,490
For example if you have an
iPhone between a 5s model,

27
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,160
all the way up through the eight series,

28
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,039
those have a thumbprint
long in called touch ID.

29
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,499
Whenever you press your index finger,

30
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:02,700
or your thumb to the
sensor it will log you in.

31
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,700
Now the newest iPhones have
done away with touch ID,

32
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,100
in favor of face ID.

33
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,010
So if you have an iPhone X or newer,

34
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,750
they actually have the front
facing camera scan your face,

35
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,220
and measure the distance between,

36
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,011
different areas of your face
to uniquely identify you.

37
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:18,560
This allows you to just
hold up the phone in front,

38
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,000
and it logs you in automatically,

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,050
by identifying that it is
you that's holding the phone.

40
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,130
These types of devices
are also being integrated,

41
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,507
into door locks and physical
access control systems,

42
00:01:27,507 --> 00:01:28,753
like man traps.

43
00:01:28,753 --> 00:01:31,160
I used to work in one high security area,

44
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,460
where every day you had
to use a retina scan,

45
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,950
to gain access to the facility.

46
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,730
I've also worked in places that have used,

47
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,380
a fingerprint and a pin number.

48
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,060
that allowed you to
get through a man trap.

49
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,570
It really does depend on how
your system wants to be set up,

50
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,660
and how your organization
views it's security practices.

51
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,400
Now with biometrics we do have,

52
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,498
a couple of challenges
that we have to focus on.

53
00:01:50,498 --> 00:01:53,740
Namely the acceptance and rejection rates.

54
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,470
Obviously since we're using biometrics,

55
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,990
as a form of authentication,

56
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,235
we should be worried about
it's false acceptance rate.

57
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:01,257
The false acceptance rate or FAR,

58
00:02:01,257 --> 00:02:04,980
is the rate that the system
authenticates a user as valid,

59
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,700
even though that person
should not have been,

60
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,780
granted access to the system.

61
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,360
For example if you walked up
to the fingerprint reader,

62
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,560
placed your finger on
it and it accepts you,

63
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,700
because the system though you were me,

64
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,240
that would be considered
a false acceptance.

65
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,530
To prevent unauthorized people,

66
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,272
from entering the building
or using our system,

67
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:24,310
we would want to ideally get
that false acceptance rate,

68
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,060
down to zero by increasing the
sensitivity of our scanners.

69
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,800
Now on the other side of the spectrum,

70
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,235
we have a false rejection.

71
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,870
And a lot of people don't think,

72
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,290
a false rejections a problem,

73
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,233
but it is just as big of a
problem as a false acceptance.

74
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:39,015
Let's go back to the last example.

75
00:02:39,015 --> 00:02:41,726
If I increase the sensitivity
of the fingerprint scanner,

76
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:42,995
to attempt to eliminate all,

77
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:45,670
of the false acceptance rates or FAR,

78
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,754
I may inadvertently increase
my false rejection rate or FRR.

79
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:52,210
A false rejection occurs any time,

80
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,570
the biometrics system denies a user,

81
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,820
who should have been allowed
access to the system.

82
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,497
So using that log in
example with my finger,

83
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:01,160
let's assume that you were able to,

84
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,080
log in as me using your fingerprint.

85
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,514
So I increase that sensitivity
up to it's highest level.

86
00:03:05,514 --> 00:03:08,740
Now there's no more false
acceptances occurring.

87
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,300
But about half of the time,

88
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,570
when I try to log in I'm being rejected.

89
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,610
Even though I'm an authorized user.

90
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,980
Now this is the idea of a false rejection,

91
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,590
and why it's also
considered a big problem.

92
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,150
Because if it's failing to allow me,

93
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,950
to authenticate half of the time,

94
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,550
that means half the time
I can't get to work.

95
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,700
So how can I perfectly tune the system,

96
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,880
to eliminate the false acceptance
and the false rejection?

97
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,470
Well I try to achieve a balance,

98
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,790
where the false acceptance rate,

99
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,530
and the false rejection rate become equal.

100
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,750
This is known as the
equal error rate or ERR,

101
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,530
more commonly though
you'll see this called,

102
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,750
the crossover error rate
or CER out in the industry.

103
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,350
This is because your
false acceptance rate,

104
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,910
and your false rejection rate,

105
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,028
intersect at that crossover
error rate or CER.

106
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:54,503
The crossover error rate uses a measure,

107
00:03:54,503 --> 00:03:57,192
of the effectiveness of a
given biometrics system.

108
00:03:57,192 --> 00:03:59,130
So when you're looking to purchase one,

109
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,510
you can use this as a factor,

110
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,959
in your decision making process.

111
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:03,370
You want one that doesn't have,

112
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,229
a huge error to the positive side,

113
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:07,390
or a huge error to the negative side.

114
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,220
If you can get one that has
a good crossover error rate,

115
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,700
that's going to make
sure that your people,

116
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,410
are getting authenticated
when you should be,

117
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,060
and rejected when they should be.

118
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,050
(electrical arc zaps quietly)
