00:00:01,243 --> 00:00:02,450
- In this section of the course,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,380
we're going to be discussing
monitoring and auditing.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,480
Let's begin with monitoring first.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,620
When we talk about monitoring,

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,810
one of the main jobs of security analyst,

6
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,820
is to really monitor the network.

7
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,060
We're like detectives, we're
trying to route out anything

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,650
that doesn't appear quite right.

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,010
And this can be done manually
or through an automated means.

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,730
When we do this to an automated means,

11
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,260
it's done through one of three methods.

12
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,580
It's either signature-based, anomaly-based

13
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,210
or behavior-based.

14
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,500
Now, when we talk about
signature-based monitoring,

15
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,630
this is where your network
traffic is analyzed

16
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,820
for predetermined attack patterns.

17
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,820
And so if I said,

18
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,860
every time you see somebody
walk through the door

19
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,760
who is five foot eight with brown hair

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,430
and whose name is Jason,
that's a signature.

21
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,750
So you would stop me at the door

22
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,420
because I met that criteria.

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,690
That's the idea with the
signature-based attack.

24
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,420
The second type is know as anomaly-based.

25
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,500
Now when we do anomaly-based monitoring,

26
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,550
we have to create a baseline
of what normal is first.

27
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,240
And once we established the baseline,

28
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,390
then we can look at any
other network traffic

29
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,500
that starts following
outside that baseline

30
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,090
for further evaluation.

31
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,020
So let's say you decided to
park your car on my street,

32
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,210
and you start watching all
the traffic that goes by,

33
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,220
and normally you see a lot
of people leave for work

34
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,500
between 7 a.m and 9 a.m

35
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,840
but, one time you saw
people not leave until noon.

36
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,220
You'd go, "hmm, that's
out of the ordinary."

37
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,180
Normally that person leaves
their house before nine,

38
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,860
and so that's outside the normal

39
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,190
and we're going to look into that further.

40
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,050
It's an anomaly, it's
outside of the baseline.

41
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,070
The third type we have is
what's known as behavior-based.

42
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,260
Behavior-based is an activity
that's going to be evaluated

43
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,100
based on previous behaviors
of the applications,

44
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,270
the executables and the
operating system in comparison

45
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,300
to the current activity of the system.

46
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,360
Now the problem with
behavior-based analysis

47
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,300
or behavior-based
monitoring is that it tends

48
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,060
to result in a lot of false positives

49
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,050
because there's a large
number of applications

50
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,540
and lots of different relationships

51
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,050
between those applications.

52
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,480
If you think about your computer,

53
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,520
how many different
applications are installed?

54
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,510
And how many ways do
they talk to each other?

55
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,200
You probably have Word,
and PowerPoint, and Excel

56
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,010
and Chrome, and Firefox and maybe Outlook.

57
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,700
And probably 50 or 60 other applications.

58
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,300
For you to be able to
create a good baseline

59
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,580
for all those applications
would take time.

60
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,610
And because that's usually not done well,

61
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,830
behavior-based tends to be
a lot of false positives

62
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,330
because people don't configure
it properly to begin with.

63
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,090
The one that has the least false positives

64
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,520
is signature-based.

65
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,290
Anomaly-based has a little bit more

66
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,530
and then behavior-based has a lot more.

67
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,700
So that's the three types
of methods we can use,

68
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,400
and these methods don't have
to be used in isolation.

69
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,310
Often times, in an intrusion detection

70
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,880
or intrusion prevention system,

71
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,770
we're actually going to combine
them into a hybrid approach.

72
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,440
So maybe I'm going to use
anomaly-based detection

73
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,140
and signature-based detection,

74
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,890
and that give me two different
ways of capturing traffic

75
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,500
for further analysis.

76
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,850
Now, that's the beginning of this section.

77
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,350
Now that we've got the
basics covered of monitoring,

78
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,873
let's dive a little bit
deeper in the next lesson.
