1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
- SSL and TLS provide the
backbone of web security.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,930
We've already talked a
lot about SSL and TSL

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,803
every time we've talked about HTTPS.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,480
But we're going to cover
a couple more details

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,910
inside of this lesson.

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,820
First, SSL and TLS, what are they?

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,710
Well, SSL stands for
the secure socket layer.

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,480
And TLS stands for
transport layer security.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,070
These are cryptographic protocols

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,300
that provide secure
internet communications

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,780
for web browsing, instant
messaging, email, VoIP,

12
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,560
and many other services.

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,650
I know we talk a lot
about it in web browsing,

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,550
but it can be used for all
of these other things too.

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,500
Now when we talk about SSL and TLS

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,480
let's start with SSL because
it's the older protocol.

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,260
SSL was what was created first.

18
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,250
It was a way to start securing the web

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,350
as we wanted to start doing E-commerce.

20
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,200
The last time SSL was updated though

21
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,730
was 1996 with SSL version three.

22
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,730
It's really old.

23
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,390
You shouldn't use SSL.

24
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,730
Instead, it's been replaced by TLS,

25
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,430
transport layer security.

26
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,910
Now, everyone watching this
should be using TLS version 1.2

27
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,730
which is the latest and greatest right now

28
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,890
as of this filming.

29
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,390
But, right around the corner

30
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,700
version 1.3 is going to be released.

31
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,760
The first drafts of it

32
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,810
are supposed to be coming out in 2019.

33
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,500
And then it's going to go into
widespread use in 2019 or 2020

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,610
as we keep moving forward
and increasing that security.

35
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,900
Now often you're going to
hear people call it SSL

36
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,740
even if it's TLS that you're using.

37
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,010
This is just something that
people call it incorrectly

38
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,630
because it's a creature of habit.

39
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,470
They've been using SSL since the 90s

40
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,030
and if you're an old guy like me,

41
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,270
you've been using it this whole time

42
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,140
and you call it secure socket layer

43
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,360
as opposed to transport layer security.

44
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,660
Whether you hear somebody say SSL or TLS,

45
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,610
most of the time they're
really referring to TLS.

46
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,820
Now, we've already covered
how TLS and SSL work

47
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,140
when we talked about the PKI lesson.

48
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,210
We talked about, if you remember,

49
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,710
that the web browser goes out

50
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,210
and gets the server's public key.

51
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,600
It then takes that and it encrypts

52
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,960
a random string of numbers,

53
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,570
sends that over to the web server.

54
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,450
And once the web server
gets it they decrypt it

55
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,770
using their private key.

56
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,770
They then create a symmetric
tunnel between the two.

57
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,170
And that symmetric tunnel,
that is SSL or TLS.

58
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,070
Most of the time it's TLS.

59
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,670
Now, again, that's because
TLS is what's current and new

60
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,120
and that's what you should be using.

61
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,750
So we've already talked
about how this works.

62
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,040
But, I want to talk
about how it can be used

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,400
with different protocols.

64
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,770
The first one is HTTPS which
we were just discussing.

65
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,870
Now, TLS operates below
these other protocols.

66
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,240
For example, if you want
to run a secure website,

67
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,250
you would tunnel the normal HTTP protocol

68
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,170
through a TLS tunnel.

69
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,460
Normally you'd use HTTP over port 80.

70
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,550
But when you tunnel it through SSL or TLS

71
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,310
you're going to end up
putting it on port 443

72
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,193
which is secure HTTP or HTTPS.

73
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,550
Next, let's talk about emails.

74
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,500
Let's say I wanted to
send an email to you.

75
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,750
Normally I'm going to use
SMTP and send it over port 25.

76
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,860
But if I want to do that securely,

77
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,360
I want to establish a TLS tunnel first.

78
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,020
I'll establish that TLS
tunnel over port 465 instead

79
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,670
and send my SMTP traffic
through that tunnel.

80
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,700
Again, it's the same
thing we did with web,

81
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,960
but now we're doing it with email.

82
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,740
And you can do that for instant messaging.

83
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,180
You can do it for a file transfer.

84
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,200
You can do it for all sorts of stuff.

85
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,370
Now, one of the things we
have to be concerned with

86
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,050
with TLS is how people can attack it.

87
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,680
And one of the most common
ways people attack it

88
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,730
is by doing a downgrade attack.

89
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,720
A downgrade attack is when a protocol

90
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,990
is tricked into using
a lower-quality version

91
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,040
instead of using the
higher-quality version

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,250
that is was supposed to.

93
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,540
So, if your server was set up

94
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,750
to be able to use version 1.2 of TLS,

95
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,190
but somebody has their browser report

96
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,460
that they only support 1.0,

97
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,400
your server may downgrade itself to 1.0

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,280
which is a weaker protocol
and can be exploited.

99
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,780
Now, why does it work that way?

100
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,900
Well, we know if somebody connects

101
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,080
to your website originally,

102
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,840
the first thing that your web
server, and that client does

103
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,660
is negotiate how they're going to talk.

104
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,260
And if I say to you, hey,
I only talk at version 1.0,

105
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,580
and you want to be able to support me,

106
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,670
you're going to downgrade to 1.0.

107
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,200
To stop this, you can
configure your web server

108
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,220
to not support downgraded versions

109
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,860
and say we're only going
to support version 1.1

110
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,910
or 1.2 for example.

111
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,410
This is a configuration you
can make inside your server.

112
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,450
And check your server documentation

113
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,470
whether it's Windows or Linux

114
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,270
on how to do this specifically
as you get into the field.

115
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,670
For the Security Plus exam

116
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,740
you need to understand
the concept of downgrade,

117
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,390
not how to actually secure it

118
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,070
by doing the hands-on
keyboard type of stuff.

119
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,050
The last thing I want to mention about TLS

120
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,820
is while it is great and
provides us lots of security,

121
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,150
as network defenders it's
actually a challenge for us.

122
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,440
Let me use this example.

123
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,100
You're sitting at your computer at work.

124
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,200
And you decide to get on Dropbox.

125
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,230
Well, if you're on Dropbox

126
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,290
and you're using the secure
version of that website,

127
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,260
you have a nice TLS
connection from your device

128
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,380
all the way to Dropbox's servers.

129
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,280
Well guess what?

130
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,120
Whenever you're putting files into there,

131
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,320
as a defender I can't
see what you're doing

132
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,620
because there's this tunnel
that I'm not a part of.

133
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,610
And so it's going to be
secure from your computer,

134
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,100
your laptop all the way to the server.

135
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,550
Well, if I need to see what's coming in

136
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,750
and out of the network, I
have to have a way to do that.

137
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,250
And the way I do that is what's
called break and inspect.

138
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,280
We talked about this back in web proxies.

139
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,020
If I can act as the man in the middle

140
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,250
by putting a proxy there,
you can connect to the proxy,

141
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,210
the proxy connects to Dropbox.

142
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,120
Now you're going to
authenticate with the proxy

143
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,380
with a TLS tunnel.

144
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,430
Then I'm going to
unencrypt what you gave me,

145
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm going to look at it, inspect it,

146
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,770
and then I'm going to encrypt
it again and send it off

147
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,940
through a secure tunnel
all the way to Dropbox.

148
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,250
And when the files come back
I can do the same thing.

149
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,070
This is how I can determine
what's coming in and out

150
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,280
of my network and looking at it

151
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,780
and making sure there's no malware

152
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,890
or any bad things coming in or out.

153
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,510
Now, by doing this I'm
going to end up eating up

154
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,280
a lot of processor resources.

155
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,980
Because I have to decrypt and
encrypt every single thing

156
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,660
that's going through that
break and inspect proxy.

157
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,980
And so when you set this up

158
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,590
you have to make sure you set it up right.
