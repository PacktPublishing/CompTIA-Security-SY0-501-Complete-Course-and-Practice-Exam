1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,960
- In this section of the course,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,210
we're going to focus on
the baseline knowledge

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,266
that you need to understand

4
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:07,750
before we can start
digging into all of the

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,973
technical pieces cyber security.

6
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:12,014
Cyber security is hard.

7
00:00:12,014 --> 00:00:14,040
There's always going to be a friction

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,778
that exists between
security and convenience.

9
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:18,600
Think about at your house.

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,210
When you set up your wireless network

11
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,894
what kind of password did you use?

12
00:00:21,894 --> 00:00:23,740
Did you use a short password

13
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,225
like puppy or baseball?

14
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,830
Or did you use something
that was much longer

15
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,025
and more complicated and
difficult to remember?

16
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:32,670
Well, if you had a long, hard,

17
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,874
and complicated password,

18
00:00:33,874 --> 00:00:36,550
your network is going
to be much more secure,

19
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,300
but it's also much less convenient.

20
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,133
Think about it.

21
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:41,310
If your friend comes over and says

22
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,730
can I connect to your Wi-Fi?

23
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,260
You've got to go type in this long,

24
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,070
complicated password each time

25
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,290
and that's just one example

26
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,410
of the challenge that we have

27
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,690
between security and convenience.

28
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,090
As people, we want convenience,

29
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,550
but when we have convenience

30
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,085
we lose out on security.

31
00:00:56,085 --> 00:00:57,540
To increase security,

32
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,740
we have to make things
a bit more challenging

33
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,920
and more difficult,

34
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,371
but, again, that takes
away from convenience.

35
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:04,740
This is the balance

36
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,790
that we're always dealing with

37
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,560
inside our organizations.

38
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,566
As organizations have
fought with this challenge,

39
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:11,290
there are things that have went out

40
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,760
in this convenience sector

41
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,870
that have given us less security.

42
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,703
As we look at that,

43
00:01:15,703 --> 00:01:16,920
that's one of the reasons

44
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,860
why we continue to have cyber attacks

45
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,549
and data breaches to this day.

46
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,470
Just last year, there was
1.3 million dollars spent

47
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,568
per data breach by major companies.

48
00:01:26,568 --> 00:01:28,440
This is an amazing fact

49
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,890
and an astounding figure,

50
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,094
but the reason is because
we have this trade-off.

51
00:01:32,094 --> 00:01:34,300
We have to make things easy for our users

52
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,260
to use them on a daily basis

53
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,990
but challenging enough
that hackers can't get in.

54
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,530
Now, this section of the course

55
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,130
we're going to talk
about those foundations.

56
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,920
Things like the CIA triad,

57
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,330
the triple As of security,

58
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,530
and much more,

59
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,850
but before we do that,

60
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,668
we have to define two terms.

61
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:53,270
This first is information security.

62
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,800
Information security is
the act of protecting data

63
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,955
and information from unauthorized access,

64
00:01:57,955 --> 00:02:00,790
unlawful modification and disruption,

65
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,164
disclosure, and corruption,
and destruction.

66
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,508
Simply put, when we talk
about information security,

67
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:08,070
we're talking about the data

68
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,440
that the systems are holding,

69
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,990
not the systems themselves.

70
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,454
Which brings us to our second definition,

71
00:02:13,454 --> 00:02:15,918
information systems security.

72
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:18,050
Information systems security

73
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,978
is the act of protecting the systems

74
00:02:19,978 --> 00:02:22,534
that hold and process our critical data.

75
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:23,686
That can be a computer,

76
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,910
a server, a network device,

77
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,033
or even your smartphone.

78
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:29,399
If we're talking about
protecting the data itself,

79
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,972
it's information security,

80
00:02:30,972 --> 00:02:33,306
but if we're talking about the
devices that hold the data,

81
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:36,487
then we're talking about
information systems security.

82
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:39,110
Now, as we go through
the rest of section one,

83
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,169
we're going to cover a
lot of different topics.

84
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:43,460
We're not going to cover
them in depth, though.

85
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,310
We're just going to scratch the
surface here in section one.

86
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,440
We'll return to them in depth

87
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,870
in sections two, three, four, and beyond,

88
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,760
as we go and get into the level of detail

89
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,220
that you'll need to be
successful in this class

90
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,833
and on the certification exam.
