1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,670
- As we move through the seven phases

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,220
of the software development lifecycle,

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,850
it's important for not to forget

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,060
the fundamentals of good security.

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,610
Our developers should always remember

6
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,980
the three tenets of the CIA triad:

7
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,150
confidentiality, integrity,
and availability.

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,160
Remember, confidentiality ensures that

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,610
only authorized users can access the data

10
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,600
being processed by an application.

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,940
The most common of
ensuring confidentiality

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,380
is to include the use of encryption

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,420
to maintain the secrecy
of the data being stored.

14
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,530
Integrity is focused on ensuring the data

15
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,410
is not modified or altered
without permission.

16
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,570
The two main ways that
we do this as developers

17
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,280
is by utilizing hash algorithms

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,430
as a method of integrity
check for the data

19
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,970
or by using journaling
and logging functions

20
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,640
to create audit trail showing the

21
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,470
integrity of the data
has not been comprised.

22
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,940
When developers are attempting
to ensure availability,

23
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,180
they're focused on ensuring
that the data is available

24
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,730
to authorized users when it's needed.

25
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,580
The most common way of
doing this is by creating

26
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,170
redundancy in the overall system design,

27
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,420
by ensuring their software
code is error-free,

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,520
or by ensuring that their
software can conduct

29
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,710
error handling appropriately
to prevent crashes.

30
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,460
During the testing phase, it's important

31
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,900
to conduct an in-depth
code review to ensure

32
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,390
that there are no vulnerabilities

33
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,810
that might affect the
confidentiality, integrity,

34
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,570
or availability of the software
or the integrated system.

35
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,330
These code reviews are generally performed

36
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,510
by programmers, not by
security analysts though.

37
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,260
On the other hand, security analysts

38
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,560
do help during the software
development lifecycle

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,540
by conducting threat modeling.

40
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,840
Threat modeling helps to
prioritize vulnerability

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,620
identification and patching
throughout the SDLC.

42
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,560
By helping to prioritize the threats,

43
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,910
the security analysts can help with

44
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,550
the identification of
applications or systems

45
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,870
that should receive
additional protections,

46
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,070
which threats are more
likely to affect them,

47
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,230
and which ones have known
vulnerabilities that exist.

48
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,580
Based on this, additional
effort and funding

49
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,870
can be applied in the most efficient way

50
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,460
to fix the issues before an attack happens

51
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,530
or an attacker can exploit them.

52
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,810
After all, there are a
lot of threats out there

53
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,920
and a lot of ways to attack a system

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,850
if you want to breach an
area of the CIA triad.

55
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,290
To best protect applications,
we should ensure

56
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,250
that good security is programmed in

57
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,760
from the beginning back
during the requirements,

58
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,400
analysis, and implementation phases.

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,940
Numerous studies have proven
that it's much cheaper

60
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,860
to utilize secure coding practices

61
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,640
and to conduct more thorough testing

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,920
before releasing a product than to try

63
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,870
to fix insecure code after
releasing the product,

64
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,720
as well as trying to clean up
from the mess of an attack.

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,210
What secure coding practices

66
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,840
should our programmers
use during development?

67
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,450
First, we should ensure that
we design our applications

68
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,550
with the concept of least privilege.

69
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,160
Least privilege means
that user or processes

70
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,450
should be run using the
least amount of access

71
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,370
necessary to perform the given function.

72
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,670
Does your application require

73
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,360
administrative permissions to run?

74
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,090
If so, why?

75
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,640
Developers should always try to use

76
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,780
the lowest permission level

77
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,270
when they're performing a function.

78
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,820
So whenever it's possible,
the program should be run

79
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,990
as a user level person instead of an

80
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,390
administrator or root level one.

81
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,300
The next practice is to
implement defense in depth.

82
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,200
Defense in depth occurs when
you layer security controls

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,190
to create a more effective and
secure application or system

84
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,410
than would be possible if you
relied on a single control.

85
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,320
Also, you should never trust user input.

86
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,230
Any input that's received from a user

87
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,380
should always undergo input validation

88
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,160
prior to allowing an
application to use it.

89
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,080
Proper input validation can stop

90
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,800
a lot of different types of attack

91
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,690
including SQL injections,
buffer overflows, and more.

92
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,250
Next, we want to minimize
our attack surface

93
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,170
in our applications and our systems.

94
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,820
This means that we should always reduce

95
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,920
the amount of code used by program,

96
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,040
we should eliminate
unneeded functionality,

97
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,140
and we should also require authentication

98
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,810
prior to running any additional plugins.

99
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,680
Developers should also
create secure defaults.

100
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,250
Most of the time, our users are going

101
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,950
to accept the default
installation configurations.

102
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,440
This can lead to
insecurities in our systems.

103
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,440
Therefore, developers should always ensure

104
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,260
the default installation
includes secure configurations

105
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,670
by default and then requires
an administrator or a user

106
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,410
to lessen those secure defaults

107
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,430
if they want to remove the security.

108
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,840
Unfortunately though,
software is often designed

109
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,150
the exact opposite to this where they have

110
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,740
insecure defaults and then
it requires an administrator

111
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,010
or a user to change them
to add additional security.

112
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,460
Next, whenever you're
deploying your applications,

113
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,610
you should always use
code signing to ensure

114
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,550
that the program has not been changed

115
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,170
either inadvertently or maliciously prior

116
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,500
to it's delivery to your end users.

117
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,210
By using digital signatures
as part of your code singing,

118
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,780
you're enabling the end user to see

119
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,120
that the program was authentic

120
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,280
and it maintains the integrity
throughout its lifecycle.

121
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,640
Another key principle that
developers should follow

122
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,530
is to ensure their code is developed

123
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,490
so that it will fail securely.

124
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,320
After all, every application
is going to fail at some point.

125
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,480
By ensuring that your application is coded

126
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,570
to properly conduct error-free
handling exceptions,

127
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,990
they can fail securely instead of crashing

128
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,120
or being exploited by an attacker.

129
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,350
Again, input validation
here will go a long way

130
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,830
in helping your programs fail securely

131
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,810
instead of just crashing.

132
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,590
Next, we have fix security issues.

133
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,280
If the vulnerability is identified,

134
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,750
it should quickly be corrected and patched

135
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,930
to remove that vulnerability

136
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,070
from your application or system.

137
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,390
After all, we don't want
known vulnerabilities

138
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,480
to remain in our applications or systems

139
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,080
because when they do, this
means that vulnerability

140
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,200
can be found by an attacker as well.

141
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,380
Since we know about it,

142
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,010
they're going to be able to find it too.

143
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,060
Finally, developers should only rely

144
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,110
on trusted SDKs and third party libraries.

145
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,620
What's an SDK?

146
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,150
An SDK is a software development kit

147
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,330
and it allows a programmer to reuse code

148
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,010
from other programmers in order

149
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,990
to save them time and effort.

150
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,050
For example, if you're developing
a new Windows application

151
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,660
there's no reason for you
to code your own function

152
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,450
to open a file on the hard drive.

153
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,460
This function exists in almost
every program out there.

154
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,720
So, there's a software development toolkit

155
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,030
that provides this function
along with many other

156
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,290
file input and output functions.

157
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,570
The same holds true for
third party libraries.

158
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,290
We are reusing somebody else's code

159
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,280
inside your own applications.

160
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,560
Whenever you're utilizing
somebody else's code,

161
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,910
you should ensure it comes
from a trusted source

162
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,840
to ensure that no malicious
code is being added to it.

163
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,510
From my file opening example,

164
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,130
I would want to use the
official Windows SDK

165
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,760
or a third party library
and not some random one

166
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,386
that I found on SourceForge or GitHub.

167
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:25,412
(upbeat music)
