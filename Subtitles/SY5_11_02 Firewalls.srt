1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,130
- Firewalls.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,770
Firewalls are primarily
used to section off

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,180
and protect one network from another.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,400
Now when we talk about firewalls,
there's three main types.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,600
There's software-based, hardware-based,

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,510
and embedded firewalls.

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,090
Software-based firewalls are
run as a piece of software

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,770
on a host or a server.

9
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,960
In fact, if you're
running a Windows server,

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,500
those have a built-in Windows
Firewall that you can enable.

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,080
Hardware firewalls, on the other hand,

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,420
are a standalone device
that's actually an appliance

13
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,090
that's installed into your network.

14
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,840
It looks like another
switch or another router

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,640
that goes into your network stack.

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,670
The third type of firewall is
known as an embedded firewall.

17
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,370
Embedded firewalls work
as a single function

18
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,380
out of many on a single device.

19
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,960
So if you have a small
office home office router

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,950
or a unified threat management device,

21
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,010
these are examples of
an embedded firewall.

22
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,140
It's one piece of the larger device

23
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,210
that does many different functions.

24
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,030
Firewalls can operate
in many different ways.

25
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,080
The first one is packet filtering.

26
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,240
Packet filtering is going
to inspect each packet

27
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,940
as it passes through the firewall,

28
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,570
and it'll accept it or reject it

29
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,510
based on the rules that it's been given.

30
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,590
This relies on the
firewall's configuration

31
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,010
and the access control
list that's been installed.

32
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,900
If I'm running a web server, for example,

33
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,900
I would configure my firewall
to allow traffic inbound

34
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,270
on port 80 and port 443

35
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,150
but close all of the other ports

36
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,300
because port 80 gives web traffic,

37
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,030
and port 443 gives secure web traffic,

38
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,890
and so, those are expected to be used.

39
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,070
There are two types of packet filtering,

40
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,130
stateless and stateful.

41
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,800
With stateless packet filtering,

42
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,890
it's simply going to
accept or reject packets

43
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,170
based on the IP address

44
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,030
and the port number that was requested.

45
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,320
So if I'm running a web server

46
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,320
and you requested to come in on port 80,

47
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,390
I would allow that,

48
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,400
but if you requested
to come in on port 53,

49
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,690
I would deny it because it's
not in my access control list.

50
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,820
Now a stateful packet
filter, on the other hand,

51
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,220
is going to keep track of requests

52
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,950
that leave through the firewall.

53
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,640
So if I make a request from
a host through the firewall,

54
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,870
it will temporarily open up a port number

55
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,150
that I made the request from,

56
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,950
some random high port number
like 50,000 or 56,000.

57
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,000
By using stateful packet inspection,

58
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,470
you can almost entirely
eliminate IP spoofing as a threat

59
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,440
because the firewall is
going to inspect the header

60
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,240
of each packet being received.

61
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,690
It's then going to compare that
against what it was expecting

62
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,760
based on the request
that recently went out,

63
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,110
and then, it's going to make
its accept or reject decisions

64
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,180
based on this addition information.

65
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,720
This is a much more in-depth inspection

66
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,820
than a stateless one does.

67
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,950
Now, NAT filtering is another
type of filtering we can do.

68
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,220
This is going to filter
traffic according to the port,

69
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,670
whether it's a TCP or UDP port.

70
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,790
This filtering can be done

71
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,820
by simply checking the
endpoint connections,

72
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,780
by matching the incoming
traffic to the requesting IP,

73
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,490
and by matching the incoming traffic

74
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,050
to the requesting IP address and port.

75
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,770
Now, the next one we have is
an application-layer gateway,

76
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,080
or ALG.

77
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,200
This is going to apply security mechanisms

78
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,000
to specific applications
such as FDP or Telnet.

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,410
Now, instead of blocking traffic

80
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,800
based on the Telnet port of port 23,

81
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,960
instead, it's going to inspect each packet

82
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,590
and determine which
application it was meant for,

83
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,570
and if it finds out that
it was meant for Telnet,

84
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,080
it would block it because
that was unauthorized.

85
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,340
This is a resource-intensive process,

86
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,950
but it is a powerful layer of security

87
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,900
that can be added on into your network.

88
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,360
These are also known as Layer 7 firewalls

89
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,810
because they operate at
the application layer.

90
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,210
The next type of firewall we have

91
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,010
is a circuit-level gateway,

92
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,490
which works at the session
layer of the OSI model

93
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,100
and applies security mechanisms

94
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,530
when a TCP or a UDP connection
is first established.

95
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,540
Now, once that connection is established,

96
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,290
the packets can then be sent or received

97
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,480
without any further inspection or checks

98
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,850
because all of that was done

99
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,030
during the session establishment.

100
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,250
Another thing we can do
is use MAC filtering,

101
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,440
and we use MAC filtering,

102
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,200
this is going to filter out computers

103
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,150
and prevent them from
accessing beyond the firewall

104
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,810
based on their MAC addresses.

105
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,140
This is used as part of
your local area network

106
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,260
before it gets out into the routing

107
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,010
and Layer 3 logical addresses

108
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,030
that go out beyond the network.

109
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,370
All of these things can be
configured based upon rules

110
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,960
set up in the firewall's
access control list.

111
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,340
In an access control list,

112
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,340
you can either explicitly
allow, explicitly deny,

113
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,010
or implicitly deny traffic

114
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,330
that's sent or received
through the firewall.

115
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,030
When I talk about an explicit allow,

116
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,510
this means that traffic should be allowed

117
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,960
to enter or leave the network

118
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,390
because the rule allows for it to happen.

119
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,520
For example, if I have
a rule like this one,

120
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,520
allow TCP 10.0.0.2 any port 80,

121
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,410
this is saying that with the host

122
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,450
that has an IP address of 10.0.0.2,

123
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,390
it can send packets out of the network

124
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,210
to any IP address it wants

125
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,560
as long as it's requesting
that over port 80,

126
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,690
which is used for web browsing normally.

127
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,410
Firewall rules are normally read

128
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,240
as an action to be
performed, allow or deny,

129
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,770
the type of traffic, TCP or UDP,

130
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,290
the IP source, the IP destination,

131
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,190
and the port that's concerned.

132
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,000
Now if I'm going to use an explicit deny,

133
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,900
this means that traffic
should not be allowed

134
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,010
to enter or leave the network
because this rule says so.

135
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,540
For example, if I have a rule like

136
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,910
deny TCP any any port 23,

137
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,180
this would deny any devices on my network

138
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,070
from sending information to any devices

139
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,590
outside of my network over port 23,

140
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,950
and this should effectively block Telnet.

141
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,470
Now, what happens if I
don't explicitly allow

142
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,500
or explicitly deny something?

143
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,150
Well, depending on your firewall,

144
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,320
it may implicitly allow
it or implicitly deny it.

145
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,780
Now, I would like to add a rule

146
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,530
that implicitly denies anything

147
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,570
to ensure that we always
have the best security.

148
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,610
I only want things allowed
that I have explicitly allowed.

149
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,760
So, basically, when a firewall
ACL is being processed,

150
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,870
it processes the traffic
from the first rule

151
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,630
all the way down to the last rule.

152
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,360
As soon as it finds a matching rule,

153
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,490
it processes that rule and
stops going the rest of the way,

154
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,250
so for an implicit deny,

155
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,210
I would just simply add a
statement at the bottom of the ACL

156
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,500
that blocks everything else

157
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,740
that has not already been blocked

158
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,670
by one of our previous rules.

159
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,150
This might look like something like

160
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,410
deny TCP any any port any.

161
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,390
Essentially, I like to think of the ACL

162
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,230
as somebody standing at the
door to a building with a list,

163
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,040
and that list has two sides to it.

164
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,640
It has the allowed people
and the denied people.

165
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,450
As you come up to the door, if
your name isn't on the list,

166
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,710
they don't find it on the
allowed or the denied,

167
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,330
then we're implicitly going
to say you can't get in,

168
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,430
but if I see that your name
is on the allowed list,

169
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,540
I'm going to let you in,

170
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,450
and if I see your name
is on the denied list,

171
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,310
I'm definitely not going to let you in.

172
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,950
That's the idea here when
we start talking about

173
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,770
explicit allow, explicit
deny, and implicit deny.

174
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,300
Most newer firewalls are
set to implicitly deny

175
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,290
by default now,

176
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,770
so the statement may not be needed

177
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,450
on your particular firewall,

178
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,770
but if you're in doubt,

179
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,120
there is no harm in
adding this implicit deny

180
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,570
at the end of your ACLs

181
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,750
to ensure that things are
going to be blocked by default,

182
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,950
and you're only allowing in

183
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,990
what you explicitly allow it to be

184
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,320
with that rule inside the ACL.

185
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,100
Now, when firewalls first
became popular to use,

186
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,290
they operated pretty much
at the Layer 3 or Layer 4.

187
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,810
This means that they would
block based on IP addresses

188
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,840
or IP addresses and ports.

189
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,980
More recently, though,
application firewalls

190
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,920
have begin rising in popularity.

191
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,320
These application firewalls
operate at Layer 7

192
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,620
of the OSI model, the application layer,

193
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,320
and this makes traffic control decisions

194
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,200
based on the applications being used,

195
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,620
things like FTP, HTTP, Telnet, and others.

196
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,290
As time continues to move on,

197
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,980
firewalls are continuing
to advance their capability

198
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,910
to control traffic in
even more complex ways.

199
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,430
This is always going to help
us increase our security

200
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,960
because we can dial in
even more specifically

201
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,540
what we're trying to block and
what we're trying to allow.

202
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,980
Now, one modern type of
firewall you may come across

203
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,770
is known as a web
application firewall, or WAF.

204
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,250
A web application firewall
is installed on a server

205
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,270
in your environment,

206
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,120
and it provides traffic
control in the data

207
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,920
that's being sent to and
from your web applications.

208
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,010
These are useful in
helping to mitigate threats

209
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,930
like cross-site scripting
and SQL injection attacks

210
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,720
because these web application firewalls

211
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,260
are designed to specifically look

212
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,720
for these type of threats and block them.

213
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,530
As you see, there are lots of
different types of firewalls

214
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,450
and lots of ways to implement them,

215
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,440
but the key is you want to make sure

216
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,360
that you're telling them
what they're allowed

217
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,910
and what they're supposed to be blocking

218
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,320
because this will help you
have a more secure network

219
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,363
as you move forward.

220
00:08:02,371 --> 00:08:04,392
