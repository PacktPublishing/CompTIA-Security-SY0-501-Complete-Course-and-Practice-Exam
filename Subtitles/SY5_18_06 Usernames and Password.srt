1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,770
- Usernames and Passwords.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,100
How do you log in to your computer

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,150
or your favorite website each day?

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,190
If you're like most people,

5
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,780
you're probably using a
username and a password, right?

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,660
It is by far the most commonly used

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,570
authentication system out there.

8
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,900
Now most companies use a
standard naming convention

9
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,070
for their usernames so you
might see something like

10
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,750
first name.last name@yourcompany.com.

11
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,583
The problem with this

12
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:25,240
is it makes one part of
that equation already known.

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,050
I already know that your
username is first name.last name

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,530
and now all I need to do
is figure out your password

15
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,090
to break into your system.

16
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,090
So for that reason,

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,500
we want to make sure we're
using strong passwords.

18
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,420
I said this before but I'll say it again,

19
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,630
strong passwords contain
uppercase letters,

20
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,450
lowercase letters, numbers,
special characters,

21
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,380
and at least eight characters or more,

22
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,190
but I prefer 14 or more.

23
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,110
Now let's go over six key tips

24
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,950
for keeping your usernames and passwords

25
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,490
and your account secure.

26
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,720
Number one, always require the user

27
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,310
to change the default password

28
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,080
whenever the account is first created.

29
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,617
If the IT guy created
the password and he said,

30
00:00:59,617 --> 00:01:01,547
"Hey, your password is 12345678,"

31
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,140
you want to change it as
soon as you get that account

32
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,310
to make sure only you know the password.

33
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,400
Number two, require that that password

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,010
is changed frequently, every 90 days.

35
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,180
You can do this by creating a
global policy to enforce this.

36
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,500
I'm going to show you
that in another lesson.

37
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,360
Number three, always change
the default administrator

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
or root password.

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,980
By default in Windows,

40
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,410
they create a default
administrator account.

41
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,880
You know what the password is?

42
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,470
Blank, it's nothing.

43
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,200
That is horrible for security.

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,120
So the first thing you should do is go in

45
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,320
and change that to a long strong password

46
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,480
and preferably disable
that administrator account.

47
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,960
Number four, you want to
disable the guest account

48
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,120
on your systems.

49
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,840
By default, Windows is going to
install an account called guest

50
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,810
on your system.

51
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,550
You want to go into your user manager

52
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,380
and from here you can
disable that account.

53
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,140
Number five, you want to
enable Control + Alt + Delete

54
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,890
for logging into the system.

55
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,690
This is going to ensure that
the user is communicating

56
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,650
with a trusted path to
the operating system

57
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,210
in case there's any malware in it.

58
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,810
You've seen this when
you go to your Windows 7

59
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,860
or your Windows 10.

60
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,510
Press Control + Alt + Delete to log in

61
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,010
and then it comes up and asks
for your username or password.

62
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,320
To turn this feature on,

63
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,530
you go to the Advanced tab

64
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,620
of the User Accounts dialogue box.

65
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,190
You can also implement this
across your entire domain

66
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,200
by using a good group policy.

67
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,810
Number six, use good, strong policies

68
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,470
in regards to your passwords.

69
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,440
Now this one is really, really important.

70
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,860
In fact, it's so important
that I'm going to dedicate

71
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,650
the entire next video to take
you into the lab environment

72
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,550
and walk you through step by step

73
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,620
how to set some important
policy requirements

74
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,510
for your passwords like the length,

75
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,160
the age, the reuse, and the complexity.

76
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,210
We'll talk about that in the next lesson.
