1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,840
- Securing network media.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,840
Network media is the cabling
that makes up our network.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,900
This can be copper,
fiber optic, or coaxial.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,690
And they're going to be
used as a connectivity

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,460
method inside of our wired networks.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,210
Now, in addition to all the
cables there's other parts

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,130
of the cabling plant
we have to think about.

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,710
All those intermediate devices

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,920
like patch panels, punch-down blocks,

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,870
and network jacks all
make up this cabling plant

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,720
that runs throughout our organization.

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,330
And each part of that can
be a vulnerability for us.

13
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,100
The first vulnerability
I want to discuss is EMI.

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,870
This stands for
electromagnetic interference.

15
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,920
Electromagnetic interference
is a disturbance

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,540
that can affect electrical circuits,

17
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,740
devices, and cables due to radiation

18
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,210
or electromagnetic conduction that occurs.

19
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,440
Now, EMI is something
that happens normally

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,020
inside our businesses
and inside our homes.

21
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,980
EMI is caused by all sorts
of things, like televisions,

22
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,920
microwaves, cordless
phones, baby monitors,

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,100
motors like inside your
vacuum, and other devices.

24
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,810
Anything that is really a powered device,

25
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,570
even handheld drills can cause
electromagnetic interference.

26
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,290
Now, to minimize EMI you
need to install shielding

27
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,030
around the source, for instance,

28
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,500
your air conditioner
lets off a lot of EMI.

29
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,200
You could put shielding around that.

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,400
Or you can shield the cable itself

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,720
by choosing shielded twisted-pair.

32
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,350
Now, STP cables, or shielded twisted-pair,

33
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,410
have foil around either each
twisted-pair in the cable

34
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,820
or around the entire
bundle of twisted-pairs

35
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,030
to prevent emanations out of the cable

36
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,550
or interference entering into the cable.

37
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,470
STP gives you double benefit, it keeps

38
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,830
things out, and it keeps things in.

39
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,290
This is good for security and helps

40
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,650
minimize this vulnerability.

41
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,260
Now, the next vulnerability we have

42
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,170
is called radio frequency
interference, or RFI.

43
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,540
RFI is just another type
of interference like EMI.

44
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,630
Like EMI it's a
disturbance that can affect

45
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,200
your electrical circuits,
your devices, and your cables.

46
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,050
But instead of being caused by electrical

47
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,160
waves it's caused by radio waves.

48
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,510
Most often from AM and FM transmission

49
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,990
towers or cellular phone towers.

50
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,370
Now, cell towers and radio
towers near your office

51
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,770
can be a big source of RFI
in your wireless networks.

52
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,870
And when you have a
significant amount of RFI

53
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,020
this can cause to network
connectivity problems

54
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,400
for your wired networks, as well

55
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,770
as disturbing your wireless networks too.

56
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,130
Now, this is something that
you're going to have to address.

57
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,600
And a lot of it is going to be addressed

58
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,970
by shielding the building
or getting stronger devices

59
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,960
that can overcome the radio frequency

60
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,860
interference that's occurring.

61
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,890
Another vulnerability we have
is what's known as crosstalk.

62
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,930
Crosstalk occurs when
a signal is transmitted

63
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,590
on one copper wire, and it creates

64
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,140
an undesired effect on
another copper wire.

65
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,550
So, when we think about
having two copper wires,

66
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,340
like inside of a twisted-pair cable,

67
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,040
if the shielding inside that protects

68
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,300
those wires comes off,
then we can actually

69
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,670
have crossover from one wire to another.

70
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,410
And that causes interference because

71
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,780
of the data emanations and EMI.

72
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,150
Crosstalk is essentially that,
but in very close proximity.

73
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,000
Now, this becomes very common with older

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,640
cable network types,
things like Cat3 networks,

75
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,710
or even some early Cat5 networks.

76
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,490
Most of our Cat5E and Cat6A networks

77
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,850
aren't really subject to
crosstalk nearly as much.

78
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,900
Another place is see
crosstalk happen a lot

79
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,350
is if you have punch-down blocks,

80
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,080
and you decide to use an older terminal,

81
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,600
like the old 66 blocks that
were used for phone lines,

82
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,490
and tried to use that for networks.

83
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,500
Networks should always use a 110 block,

84
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,270
like you learned back in
Network+ and A+ because it gives

85
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,660
more spacing and prevents
crosstalk from occurring.

86
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,360
The next thing you want to
talk about here is STP cables

87
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,300
because STP cables are really
helpful to our networks.

88
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,570
They can prevent some of that
RFI, they can prevent EMI.

89
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,560
And they can help with crosstalk.

90
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,190
If you use those individual
shielded twisted-pair cables

91
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,320
it's really going to help eliminate

92
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,170
crosstalk altogether for you.

93
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,560
Unfortunately, though, most
organizations don't use STP.

94
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,150
They still use unshielded
twisted-pair cabling.

95
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,450
The reason is it's a lot
cheaper and easier to work with.

96
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,920
Because of this you're going to see a lot

97
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,410
of organizations favor UTP cabling

98
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,400
as opposed to STP cabling.

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,080
Because, again, the cost is
about 50% higher to use STP.

100
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,060
Now data emanations is another
issue we have to think about.

101
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,860
When we talked about EMI we
were talking about things

102
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,550
trying to get into our
network and causing issues.

103
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,220
Well, data emanation is the opposite.

104
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,160
It comes from inside your cable,

105
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,900
and it starts generating
a field around that cable

106
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,270
that when you're transmitting information

107
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,920
over the network could be picked up

108
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,260
by somebody who's trying to capture that.

109
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,850
This is things on your
network trying to escape.

110
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,120
So, if somebody is nearby
they can actually capture

111
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,570
those data emanations,
and they could reconstruct

112
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,010
that data that was
traveling over your network.

113
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,150
This is kind of paranoid
level stuff here, right?

114
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,630
And you probably aren't
going to deal with this much

115
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,860
in your organization,
unless you're a contractor

116
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,850
for something like the
military or the government

117
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,030
who holds really valuable information,

118
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,400
and they have these top secret
military defensive plans,

119
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,430
that's when you have to start thinking

120
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,530
about data emanations as a real threat.

121
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,650
So if you're like most people,

122
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,900
and you're working for a corporation,

123
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,360
though, you're probably not nearly

124
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,270
as worried about data emanations.

125
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,900
But something else the attackers can do

126
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,030
is tap into your communications doing

127
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,460
it locally using physical connections.

128
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,870
Now, what do I mean by this?

129
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,170
Well, if they can get
physical access to your space,

130
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,450
and get into your network closet,

131
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,050
and touch your punch-down panel,

132
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,680
they could actually tap into it there

133
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,040
and get a copy of the network traffic.

134
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,780
For example, this was very
common with phone networks.

135
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,930
If as an attacker I could
get into your office building

136
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,780
and find your patch panel I could use

137
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,740
a telephone technician's butt
set like the one shown here,

138
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,400
and attach it to the patch panel,

139
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,330
and listen to all of the phone
calls that were being made.

140
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,440
Now, if you're trying to
tap into the network itself

141
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,230
the easiest thing to do here is to find

142
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,030
an RJ45 port somewhere in the building.

143
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,740
Once you get into the
building, and you've gotten

144
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,340
into one of those jacks,
you can plug your laptop in.

145
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,830
And if they're not using MAC filtering

146
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,210
you're already connected.

147
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,650
If they are using MAC
filtering you're going to have

148
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,270
to bypass that, but that's
not too hard to do either.

149
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,150
Now, to prevent this
you want to use things

150
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,690
like Network Access Control,
and some other things

151
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,500
like network segmentation and VLANs.

152
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,280
So if an attacker does
get onto your network

153
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,800
they're stuck into one corner of it,

154
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,030
and they can't spread out
across the whole thing.

155
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,850
Now, if you can't find an open jack,

156
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,140
but you still want to collect things

157
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,310
completely passively, you can do this

158
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,880
by splitting the wires of
a twisted-pair connection.

159
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,740
You can open up the cable in
an area that nobody is seeing.

160
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,970
You can cut the wire and
solder on additional wires

161
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,620
to each of the twisted-pair's
internal cables.

162
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,380
This will give you a copy of
the data and you can plug it

163
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,900
back in and give the
network a copy of the data.

164
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,970
This lets you capture
the data as it transmits

165
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,530
back and forth over the network

166
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,220
completely passively, and
no one's going to see it.

167
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,750
But, again, you've got to get
physical access to the network

168
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,740
and get close enough
to be able to do this.

169
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,020
Now, I mentioned data emanations earlier,

170
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,450
but we really didn't talk
about how you can capture them.

171
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,250
To capture them you'll
use a spectrum analyzer.

172
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,310
This is going to capture
all of the radio frequencies

173
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,470
that are openly available in the area.

174
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,280
You can then dial it in for
that particular network itself

175
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,670
and dump that amount of radio frequency

176
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,260
into a program that will convert it

177
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,610
back to the ones and
zeroes of the network.

178
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,920
Load that into a packet
analyzer like Wireshark,

179
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,190
and you now have data from the network.

180
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,240
To prevent data emanations from happening

181
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,620
you should switch your
networks to fiber optic cables

182
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,830
because they don't have
any emanation at all.

183
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,170
Because fiber optic cables work with light

184
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,580
instead of electricity
there's no radiation

185
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,760
outside of the cable,
and they're not affected

186
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,660
by EMI or radio frequency either.

187
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,440
Now, are fiber optic
cables completely safe?

188
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,390
Well, no, of course not because
attackers are smart people.

189
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,580
And they always come up with creative

190
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,410
ways of bypassing security.

191
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,900
In fact, they've created what's called

192
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,440
a fiber optic splitter, where
they can attach the device

193
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,300
to a fiber port on one
side, and get two copies

194
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,530
of every piece of
communication, one that will go

195
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,280
into their machine, and one
that will go into your network.

196
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,870
That way you don't even
know they're there.

197
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,720
And it's a completely passive
way to tap the network.

198
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,420
So, how do we prevent all of these

199
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,020
type of issues from happening?

200
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,540
Well, you may have noticed that most

201
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,540
of these attacks are
occurring by the person

202
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,090
physically touching the network to tap it.

203
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,540
To prevent this you can install

204
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,670
a protected distribution system, or a PDS.

205
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,830
A PDS is a secured system of
cable management to ensure

206
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,600
that the wired network remains
free from eavesdropping,

207
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,770
tapping, data emanations,
and other threats.

208
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,300
They are kind of expensive, though,

209
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,640
because they add locks
to every network closet.

210
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,690
They enclose every cable
distribution point.

211
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,120
And they run cables
through a protected conduit

212
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,730
that runs throughout the ceiling.

213
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,250
Because of this expense I've
only really seen this used

214
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,440
in very large organizations
that are really worried

215
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,500
about security, government
buildings, or the military.

216
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,410
Most small businesses and
most medium-sized businesses

217
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,460
aren't going to use a
protected distribution system.

218
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,840
Now, I know we covered
a lot in this lesson.

219
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,880
And the exam isn't going to focus on much

220
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,640
of the information we covered,
so don't worry too much.

221
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,010
Now, I just wanted to expose you

222
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,980
to all these concepts to
ensure that you've heard it

223
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,060
at least once during your studies.

224
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,870
The biggest questions you're
going to see on the exam

225
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,300
from this lesson are going
to be about EMI, RFI,

226
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,740
and the concept of wire tapping a network.

227
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,180
That said, in the real
world you do need to think

228
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,490
about these things from an
attacker's point of view,

229
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,350
so you can determine what is a real threat

230
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,650
that you should put money against,

231
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,140
and what you can decide
is an unlikely risk.

232
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,880
And you're going to just
accept it the way it is,

233
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,024
and not spend money to mitigate it.
